## Section 1: What This Task Is

**Definition**
"Appraise team member performance against key performance indicators, support and recognize team member growth and development, determine appropriate feedback approach, and verify performance improvements."

**Core Principle**
Performance support is continuous, not annual. Project managers create environments where feedback flows freely, recognition happens often, and development opportunities emerge regularly. Unlike functional managers with formal authority, PMs influence performance through feedback, coaching, recognition, and creating conditions where people excel.

## Section 2: ECO Enablers

✓ Appraise team member performance against key performance indicators
✓ Support and recognize team member growth and development  
✓ Determine appropriate feedback approach
✓ Verify performance improvements

## Section 3: Key Frameworks

### SBI Feedback Model
| Component | Question | Example |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **S**ituation | When/where did it happen? | "In yesterday's sprint review..." |
| **B**ehavior | What observable action occurred? | "...you presented without testing first..." |
| **I**mpact | What was the effect? | "...which caused the demo to fail in front of stakeholders." |

### Performance Equation
```
Performance = Ability × Motivation × Opportunity
```
| Factor | Symptoms | Intervention |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| Ability Gap | Makes mistakes, asks many questions | Training, mentoring, pair work |
| Motivation Issue | Disengaged, minimal effort | Recognition, meaningful work |
| Opportunity Blocker | Complains about obstacles | Remove impediments, provide resources |

### Recognition Types
| Dimension | Options |
|-----------|---------|
| **Formality** | Formal (awards, bonuses) vs. Informal (verbal praise, thank-you) |
| **Visibility** | Public (team meetings) vs. Private (1-on-1 conversations) |

### Performance Continuum
```
Coaching → Mentoring → Counseling → Corrective Action
```

## Section 4: How To Apply It

### Delivering Effective Feedback
1. **Prepare**: Write out your SBI before the conversation
2. **Private Setting**: Constructive feedback always in private
3. **Timely**: Deliver within 24-48 hours of the event
4. **Two-Way**: After SBI, ask for their perspective
5. **Action-Oriented**: End with "What can we do differently?"

### SBI Examples

**Constructive:**
> **S**: "In yesterday's client demo..."
> **B**: "...you presented the feature without testing it first, and it crashed twice..."
> **I**: "...which made the client question our quality practices and delayed sign-off by a week."

**Positive:**
> **S**: "During this morning's standup..."
> **B**: "...you proactively offered to help Alex with the API integration..."
> **I**: "...which allowed us to stay on track for the sprint goal."

### Recognition Best Practices (T.A.P.S.)
- **T**imely: Recognize close to the event
- **A**uthentic: Be genuine; people detect fake praise
- **P**ersonal: Match recognition to individual preferences
- **S**pecific: State exactly what they did and why it mattered

---

## Section 5: Exam Triggers

When you see these in a question, think **Support Team Performance**:

• Team member underperforming
• Performance review or appraisal needed
• Recognition opportunity identified
• Skill gap discovered
• Team productivity declining
• "How should feedback be delivered?"
• Development plan request
• "Team member struggling with..."
• "Solid performer not being recognized"
• Coaching conversation needed

---

## Section 6: Quick Scenarios

| Scenario | Right/Wrong | Why |
|----------|-------------|-----|
| PM gives constructive feedback in a team meeting | ❌ Wrong | Constructive feedback should always be private |
| PM uses SBI to explain why a behavior was problematic | ✅ Right | SBI is specific, behavioral, and actionable |
| PM waits for annual review to discuss ongoing issues | ❌ Wrong | Feedback should be timely, not saved up |
| PM asks team member about recognition preferences | ✅ Right | Recognition should be personalized |
| PM escalates to functional manager before coaching | ❌ Wrong | Coach directly first, then escalate |
| PM investigates root cause before assuming fault | ✅ Right | Performance issues may be system problems |

---

## Section 7: Common Mistakes

### Wrong Answer Patterns on Exam

| Trap | Why It's Wrong | Better Approach |
|------|----------------|-----------------|
| **"Address in team meeting"** | Public criticism damages trust | Always private for issues |
| **"Document and escalate"** | Skips direct conversation | Coach first, document, then escalate |
| **"Wait for formal review"** | Delayed feedback loses impact | Address issues promptly |
| **"Tell them to improve"** | Vague, not actionable | Use SBI with specific behaviors |
| **"Assume they know"** | People need explicit feedback | Don't rely on hints |
| **"Same recognition for all"** | People have different preferences | Personalize recognition |
| **"Focus on personality"** | Feels like personal attack | Focus on observable behavior |
| **"Ignore solid performers"** | Silence breeds disengagement | Recognize proactively |

### The "Feedback Sandwich" Trap
PMI does **not** recommend the feedback sandwich (positive-negative-positive). Instead, be direct and respectful with clear, behavioral feedback.

## Section 1: How This Task Is Tested

Support Team Performance questions test your ability to apply feedback frameworks, choose appropriate recognition approaches, and address performance issues professionally. Expect 3-5 questions specifically on this task, with overlap in stakeholder and team leadership questions.

### Question Patterns

| Pattern | What They Test | Key Signals |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| **Feedback Approach** | Which method for delivering feedback? | "Team member made a mistake...", "How should the PM address..." |
| **Recognition Timing** | When/how to recognize contributions | "Team delivered ahead of schedule...", "Individual went above and beyond..." |
| **Performance Investigation** | Root cause before action | "Team member's work quality declined...", "Previously strong performer now struggling..." |
| **Escalation Decisions** | When to involve functional manager | "Coaching hasn't worked...", "Serious performance issue..." |
| **Development Planning** | Supporting growth | "Skill gap identified...", "Team member wants to grow..." |

### What PMI Expects

- **Investigate before judging** — Understand root cause first
- **Direct conversation first** — Don't skip to escalation
- **Timely feedback** — Don't wait for formal reviews
- **SBI for specificity** — Avoid vague or personal feedback
- **Match recognition to person** — Not one-size-fits-all

---

## Section 2: Sample Question 1

**Scenario:**
A team member who has been performing well for six months suddenly starts missing deadlines and producing lower quality work. The PM has noticed this pattern over the past two sprints. What should the PM do FIRST?

**Options:**
A) Document the performance issues and schedule a formal performance review
B) Have a private conversation to understand what might be causing the change
C) Assign the team member less critical work until performance improves
D) Notify the functional manager about the performance decline

**Correct Answer: B**

### Analysis

**Why B is correct:**
The key word is "FIRST." Before taking any formal action, the PM should investigate the root cause. A previously good performer suddenly declining suggests something has changed — personal issues, unclear requirements, impediments, or other factors. A private conversation shows respect and gathers information needed to help effectively.

**Why others are wrong:**

| Option | Problem |
|--------|---------|
| A | Skips investigation; documentation is for after conversation |
| C | Doesn't address the issue; may demotivate further |
| D | Escalates before direct engagement; PM should coach first |

### Key Principle
**Investigate root cause before assuming fault.** Performance = Ability × Motivation × Opportunity. The PM needs to diagnose which factor changed.

---

## Section 3: Sample Question 2

**Scenario:**
A developer submits code without proper testing, causing a bug that affects production for two hours. This is the second time this month. The PM needs to address this. What is the BEST approach?

**Options:**
A) Tell the developer they need to be more careful in the future
B) Have a private conversation using specific examples of the behavior and its impact
C) Send an email documenting the incidents and copy the functional manager
D) Discuss the issue in the next team retrospective as a process improvement

**Correct Answer: B**

### Analysis

**Why B is correct:**
This describes the SBI approach without naming it. "Specific examples" = Situation + Behavior. "Impact" = Impact. Private conversation respects the individual while addressing a real issue that needs correction. This is direct, professional, and actionable.

**Why others are wrong:**

| Option | Problem |
|--------|---------|
| A | Vague ("be more careful" isn't actionable), no SBI, no dialogue |
| C | Escalates without direct conversation first; email feels punitive |
| D | Makes individual issue a team discussion; embarrassing and ineffective |

### Key Principle
**Use SBI for behavioral feedback.** Specific, observable, impact-focused feedback is actionable. Vague instructions ("be more careful") don't help people improve.

---

## Section 4: Sample Question 3

**Scenario:**
The project team just delivered a critical milestone two weeks ahead of schedule. The success was primarily due to collaborative effort, though one senior developer contributed exceptionally by solving a complex integration problem. How should the PM handle recognition?

**Options:**
A) Recognize only the senior developer publicly to motivate others to perform similarly
B) Recognize the team publicly, then separately acknowledge the senior developer privately
C) Recognize only the team to avoid creating competition among team members
D) Let team members self-nominate who should receive recognition

**Correct Answer: B**

### Analysis

**Why B is correct:**
Both contributions deserve recognition. The team collaborated to hit the milestone (team recognition), AND one individual went above and beyond (individual recognition). Recognizing both honors the truth without undermining team dynamics. Private individual recognition avoids creating unhealthy competition.

**Why others are wrong:**

| Option | Problem |
|--------|---------|
| A | Undermines team contribution; creates "hero culture" |
| C | Fails to recognize exceptional individual effort; demotivating |
| D | Abdicates PM responsibility; may create awkwardness |

### Key Principle
**Both team and individual recognition matter.** Great PMs acknowledge collective wins AND individual standouts — appropriately and in the right setting.

---

## Section 5: Exam Strategy

### Do This ✓

| Action | Why |
|--------|-----|
| Investigate root causes before acting | Performance issues may be systemic, not individual |
| Give feedback privately and promptly | Respect + timeliness = effective feedback |
| Use specific, behavioral feedback (SBI) | Actionable and non-personal |
| Recognize both team and individual | Different contributions deserve different recognition |
| Match recognition to preferences | Not everyone wants public praise |
| Address issues directly before escalating | PM should coach first |
| Focus on development, not punishment | Growth mindset improves performance |

### Don't Do This ✗

| Trap | Why It's Wrong |
|------|----------------|
| Wait for annual reviews | Feedback loses impact over time |
| Make feedback personal or judgmental | Feels like attack; damages relationship |
| Publicly criticize individuals | Humiliating; destroys trust |
| Escalate before direct conversation | Skips PM responsibility |
| Ignore underperformance | Problems don't fix themselves |
| Use one-size-fits-all recognition | Different people prefer different approaches |
| Document as first action | Investigation and coaching come first |

### Signal Words

**Correct answer signals:**
- "Have a private conversation..."
- "Understand the root cause..."
- "Provide specific feedback..."
- "Recognize promptly..."
- "Create development plan..."
- "Coach before escalating..."

**Wrong answer signals:**
- "Ignore the issue..."
- "Wait for formal review..."
- "Escalate immediately..."
- "Document for later..."
- "Publicly address..."
- "Assume they know..."
- "Be more careful..." (too vague)

## Section 1: Introduction

Supporting team performance is one of the most nuanced competencies for project managers. Technical skills get you to the table, but your ability to give feedback, recognize contributions, develop people, and address problems determines whether your team thrives or merely survives.

Unlike functional managers who have formal authority over team members' careers (hiring, firing, raises, promotions), project managers must influence performance through:

- **Feedback** — Regular, specific, actionable input
- **Recognition** — Acknowledging and celebrating contributions
- **Development** — Providing growth opportunities
- **Coaching** — Helping team members improve
- **Environment** — Creating conditions for success
- **Advocacy** — Championing team members with their managers

This creates a unique challenge: how do you improve performance without traditional management levers?

**What You'll Learn:**
1. The SBI feedback model in depth
2. Recognition strategies that actually work
3. How to address underperformance without destroying relationships
4. Development planning approaches
5. When and how to escalate
6. How this connects to other ECO tasks

---

## Section 2: The SBI Feedback Model

### Why SBI Works

Most feedback fails because it's:
- **Vague**: "You need to communicate better"
- **Judgmental**: "You're being lazy"
- **Delayed**: Delivered weeks after the event
- **Personal**: Attacks character, not behavior

SBI solves all four problems by forcing specificity, objectivity, timeliness, and focus on observable actions.

### The Three Components

**Situation (S)**
- Anchors the feedback to a specific moment
- Creates shared context
- Prevents "you always" generalizations
- Examples: "In yesterday's standup...", "During the client call this morning...", "When you submitted the PR on Tuesday..."

**Behavior (B)**
- Describes observable actions only
- No interpretations, assumptions, or mind-reading
- What would a camera have recorded?
- Examples: "You interrupted twice while Sarah was presenting", "You submitted code without unit tests", "You stayed late to help debug the issue"

**Impact (I)**
- Connects behavior to consequences
- Answers "So what? Why does this matter?"
- Can be impact on project, team, stakeholders, or individual
- Examples: "...which made Sarah lose her train of thought", "...which caused 3 bugs to reach production", "...which allowed us to meet the deadline"

### SBI Examples

**Constructive (Issue-focused):**
> "In yesterday's sprint planning **(S)**, you committed to 8 story points but only completed 3 **(B)**. This put pressure on the rest of the team to pick up the slack and we still missed our sprint goal **(I)**. Can you help me understand what happened?"

**Positive (Recognition-focused):**
> "During the production incident last night **(S)**, you immediately took ownership, coordinated the response team, and communicated updates every 15 minutes to stakeholders **(B)**. This kept executives informed, prevented panic, and we resolved the issue 2 hours faster than our average **(I)**. That's exactly the leadership we need."

### SBI Delivery Framework

1. **Prepare**: Write out your SBI before the conversation
2. **Private setting**: Constructive feedback always in private
3. **Timely**: Deliver within 24-48 hours
4. **Open dialogue**: After SBI, ask "What's your perspective?"
5. **Forward-focused**: End with "What can we do differently?"

### Common SBI Mistakes

| Mistake | Example | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Situation too vague | "Lately..." | "In Tuesday's meeting..." |
| Behavior includes judgment | "You were rude" | "You interrupted three times" |
| Impact assumed | "...which was unprofessional" | "...which made the client ask if we had conflicts" |
| No dialogue | Deliver and leave | Ask for their perspective |

---

## Section 3: Recognition & Development

### The Performance Equation

```
Performance = Ability × Motivation × Opportunity
```

When performance declines, diagnose which factor is the cause:

| Factor | Signs | Questions to Ask | Interventions |
|--------|-------|------------------|---------------|
| **Ability** | Makes mistakes, asks many questions, work takes too long | "What training would help?" "Where do you feel stuck?" | Training, mentoring, pair work, clearer docs |
| **Motivation** | Disengaged, minimal effort, seems checked out | "What would make this more meaningful?" "What's on your mind?" | Recognition, meaningful work, address concerns |
| **Opportunity** | Complains about obstacles, waits often, blocked | "What's getting in your way?" "What do you need?" | Remove blockers, provide resources, advocate |

### Why Recognition Matters

Research consistently shows recognition is one of the most powerful performance drivers:
- 69% of employees would work harder if better recognized
- Recognition is the #1 driver of "great work"
- Lack of recognition is a top reason people leave

### Types of Recognition

**By Formality:**
| Type | Examples | Best For |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Formal** | Awards, bonuses, promotions, certificates | Major achievements, milestone completions |
| **Informal** | Verbal praise, thank-you notes, shout-outs | Daily contributions, effort, improvement |

**By Visibility:**
| Type | Examples | Best For |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Public** | Team meetings, Slack channels, announcements | People who prefer visibility, team wins |
| **Private** | 1-on-1 praise, personal notes, quiet thanks | Introverts, personal achievements |

### The T.A.P.S. Recognition Framework

- **T**imely: Recognize as close to the event as possible
- **A**uthentic: Be genuine; people detect fake praise instantly
- **P**ersonal: Match recognition to individual preferences
- **S**pecific: State exactly what they did and why it mattered

### Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory

**Hygiene Factors** (prevent dissatisfaction):
- Salary, job security, working conditions, policies
- Must be adequate, but more doesn't increase motivation

**Motivators** (drive engagement):
- Achievement, recognition, meaningful work, growth, responsibility
- These are your levers as a PM

True motivation comes from meaningful work, recognition, and growth. Focus your development conversations there.

## Section 4: Practical Application

### Addressing Underperformance

**Step 1: Observe and Document**
- Note specific instances (dates, situations, behaviors)
- Look for patterns
- Avoid conclusions based on single events

**Step 2: Diagnose Root Cause**
- Is it Ability, Motivation, or Opportunity?
- What changed? (New team? New technology? Personal situation?)
- What's within their control vs. systemic issues?

**Step 3: Have the Conversation**
1. **Open**: "I want to discuss some observations and hear your perspective."
2. **Share**: Use SBI to describe specific performance gaps
3. **Listen**: "What's been happening from your perspective?"
4. **Explore**: "What do you think is contributing to this?"
5. **Plan**: "What can we do to address this together?"
6. **Commit**: "Let's agree on specific actions and check in on [date]."

**Step 4: Create Improvement Plan**
- Specific, measurable goals
- Timeline for improvement
- Resources and support provided
- Check-in frequency
- Consequences if no improvement (be honest)

**Step 5: Follow Up**
- Monitor progress against plan
- Provide feedback during improvement period
- Recognize improvements
- Document conversations

**Step 6: Escalate if Necessary**
If improvement doesn't occur despite support:
- Document all coaching attempts
- Involve functional manager
- Consider reassignment or removal from project

### The Underperformance Conversation Script

**What to Say:**
> "Alex, I want to have a candid conversation with you. Over the past three sprints, I've noticed that the features you've delivered have required significant rework—averaging about 40% revision after code review. This is causing delays for the team and extra work for reviewers.
> 
> I want to understand what's happening from your perspective. Is there something going on that I should know about? Are there obstacles or gaps I can help address?
> 
> What I'd like is for us to work together on a plan to get things back on track. I believe you can do great work—I've seen it before—and I want to support you in getting there."

**What NOT to Say:**
> "Your work has been terrible lately. You need to do better or there will be consequences. I don't know what's wrong with you."

### Coaching vs. Corrective Action Spectrum

| Approach | When to Use | Tone | Focus |
|----------|-------------|------|-------|
| **Coaching** | First response; skill development | Collaborative | Growth and capability |
| **Counseling** | Escalation; specific issues persist | More directive | Clear expectations |
| **Corrective Action** | Last resort; patterns continue | Formal | Documentation and consequences |

---

## Section 5: Common Challenges

### Challenge 1: "I don't have authority"
**Reality:** You don't need formal authority. You have influence through feedback, recognition, work assignments, advocacy, and environment.
**Action:** Focus on what you can control. Be a champion for your team members with their functional managers.

### Challenge 2: "I'm uncomfortable giving negative feedback"
**Reality:** Avoiding feedback hurts the person more. They can't improve what they don't know about.
**Action:** Reframe as "helping them succeed." Use SBI to keep it professional. Practice with low-stakes situations.

### Challenge 3: "The person gets defensive"
**Reality:** Defensiveness often means the feedback felt personal rather than behavioral.
**Action:** Double-check your SBI. Focus on behavior, not character. Ask for their perspective. Give them time to process.

### Challenge 4: "Nothing changes after feedback"
**Reality:** Feedback without follow-up is just venting.
**Action:** Create specific action plans. Schedule follow-ups. Make expectations clear. Recognize progress.

### Challenge 5: "High performers don't need feedback"
**Reality:** Silence can feel like indifference. High performers leave when they feel unappreciated.
**Action:** Proactive recognition. Development conversations. New challenges. Public appreciation.

### Challenge 6: "Remote teams make feedback harder"
**Reality:** Less natural observation means more intentional check-ins needed.
**Action:** Schedule regular 1-on-1s. Use video for important conversations. Create virtual recognition rituals. Be more explicit with written praise.

## Section 6: Connections to Other Tasks

### Task 2: Lead a Team
- Leadership style affects how feedback is received
- Coaching is a leadership style (Goleman)
- Servant leadership means developing people first
- *Connection: How you lead determines how your feedback lands*

### Task 4: Empower Team Members
- Empowerment requires capability
- Performance support builds capability
- Recognition reinforces empowered behavior
- *Connection: Support performance → Build capability → Increase empowerment*

### Task 5: Ensure Team Training
- Skill gaps identified through performance support
- Training addresses the Ability component
- Development plans often include formal training
- *Connection: Performance gaps reveal training needs*

### Task 7: Address Impediments
- Performance issues may be caused by blockers
- Investigate system problems before assuming individual fault
- "Opportunity" in the performance equation = impediments removed
- *Connection: Sometimes "underperformance" is actually "blocked performance"*

### Task 14: Apply Emotional Intelligence
- Self-awareness helps you deliver feedback well
- Social awareness helps you recognize how feedback lands
- Relationship management is built through effective performance support
- *Connection: EQ is how you deliver; performance support is what you deliver*

---

## Section 7: Key Takeaways

1. **SBI is your feedback framework.** Situation → Behavior → Impact. Use it for both constructive and positive feedback. No exceptions.

2. **Recognition is not optional.** Build habits around timely, specific recognition. Ask about preferences. Different people want different things.

3. **Investigate before judging.** Performance = Ability × Motivation × Opportunity. Diagnose the root cause before prescribing solutions.

4. **Coach before escalating.** Exhaust your coaching options before involving functional managers. You'll build trust and often solve the problem.

5. **Private for problems, flexible for praise.** Constructive feedback is always private. Recognition depends on the person's preference.

6. **Development is your job.** Help people grow, don't just utilize them. Their growth is your legacy.

7. **Feedback is timely.** Within 24-48 hours. Delayed feedback loses impact and feels like ambush.

8. **Document coaching conversations.** Protect yourself and create accountability. But document after you've actually had the conversation.

9. **Focus on behavior, not personality.** Observable actions, not character judgments. "You interrupted" not "You're rude."

10. **Solid performers need attention too.** Silence breeds disengagement. Proactive recognition retains your best people. Don't take them for granted.
