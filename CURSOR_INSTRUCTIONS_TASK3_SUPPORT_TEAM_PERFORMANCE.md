Support Team Performance
Overview

Definition
"Appraise team member performance against key performance indicators, support and recognize team member growth and development, determine appropriate feedback approach, and verify performance improvements."

ECO Enablers
✓ Appraise team member performance against key performance indicators
✓ Support and recognize team member growth and development
✓ Determine appropriate feedback approach
✓ Verify performance improvements

Core Principle
Performance support is continuous, not annual. Project managers create environments where feedback flows freely, recognition happens often, and development opportunities are provided regularly.

Key Frameworks

📊 SBI Feedback Model
S = Situation (When/Where)
B = Behavior (Observable action)
I = Impact (Effect on project/team)

⭐ Recognition Types
Formal: Awards, bonuses, promotions
Informal: Verbal praise, thank you notes
Public: Team meetings, announcements
Private: 1-on-1 conversations, personal notes

📈 Performance Continuum
Coaching → Mentoring → Counseling → Corrective Action

Exam Triggers
• Team member underperforming
• Performance review needed
• Recognition opportunity identified
• Skill gap discovered
• Team productivity declining
• Feedback approach question
• Development plan request

Performance Management Framework

📊 1. Measure Performance
When: Throughout project lifecycle
Action: Track against clear, objective criteria
Metrics: Quality, timeliness, collaboration, technical skill
Key: Focus on outcomes, not just activities

📈 2. Provide Feedback
When: Continuously, not just at reviews
Action: Timely, specific, behavioral using SBI
Approach: Regular 1-on-1s, real-time coaching
Key: Balance positive and constructive

🎯 3. Coach and Develop
When: Skill gaps or growth opportunities identified
Action: Create development plans, provide resources
Focus: Building capabilities, not just fixing problems
Key: Match development to career aspirations

🌟 4. Recognize and Reward
When: Good performance, extra effort, improvement
Action: Public recognition, private appreciation
Types: Formal awards, informal thanks, opportunities
Key: Timely, specific, authentic

⚠️ 5. Address Underperformance
When: Performance consistently below expectations
Action: Private conversation, improvement plan, follow-up
Process: Document, set clear expectations, monitor
Key: Seek root causes before assuming fault

SBI Feedback Examples

✅ Good SBI Example:
S: "In yesterday's sprint review..."
B: "...you presented the demo without testing it first..."
I: "...which caused the feature to fail in front of stakeholders, damaging their confidence in our team."

❌ Bad Feedback (No SBI):
"You're always unprepared for demos."
Problem: Vague, judgmental, not actionable

✅ Good Positive SBI:
S: "During this morning's standup..."
B: "...you proactively offered to help Alex with the API integration..."
I: "...which allowed us to stay on track for the sprint goal. The team really appreciated your collaboration."

Recognition Best Practices

⭐ 1. Make It Timely
When: Immediately after good performance
Why: Reinforces behavior, shows attention
How: Real-time praise in team meetings or Slack
Avoid: Waiting for formal reviews

🎯 2. Be Specific
When: Always
Why: Shows you notice details, more meaningful
How: "Great job resolving that API issue in 2 hours" vs "Good work"
Avoid: Generic praise without specifics

👥 3. Match Preference
When: Recognizing individuals
Why: Some prefer public, others private
How: Ask team members their preference upfront
Avoid: Assuming everyone wants public recognition

🏆 4. Recognize Effort, Not Just Results
When: Team tries hard despite challenges
Why: Encourages continuous improvement
How: Acknowledge problem-solving attempts, learning
Avoid: Only recognizing successful outcomes

🎁 5. Use Multiple Forms
When: Ongoing
Why: Different people value different rewards
How: Praise, bonuses, development opportunities, flexibility
Avoid: One-size-fits-all approach

Quick Scenarios

📋 Scenario 1: Team member consistently delivers late, low-quality work
❌ Wrong: Immediately escalate to functional manager
✅ Right: Private 1-on-1 to understand root cause, create improvement plan
Why: PM should address performance issues directly before escalating

📋 Scenario 2: Developer stays late to fix critical production bug
❌ Wrong: Say nothing, assume they know you appreciate it
✅ Right: Thank them immediately, recognize publicly in team meeting
Why: Good performance should be recognized promptly and specifically

📋 Scenario 3: Team member asks for feedback on their performance
❌ Wrong: "Everything's fine" with no specifics
✅ Right: Specific examples of strengths and areas for growth using SBI
Why: Vague feedback provides no actionable information

📋 Scenario 4: Junior developer improving rapidly but still has skill gaps
❌ Wrong: Focus only on what's still wrong
✅ Right: Recognize progress, create development plan for gaps
Why: Recognize improvement while supporting continued growth

📋 Scenario 5: Team member's personal issue affecting work performance
❌ Wrong: Ignore it to respect privacy
✅ Right: Private conversation offering support and flexibility
Why: Show care while maintaining performance expectations

Exam Question Analysis

Sample Question 1: Feedback Timing

"During a code review, you notice a developer made the same mistake they made last week despite your previous feedback. What should you do?"

A) Document the issue and add it to their annual review
B) Discuss with their functional manager about the recurring problem
C) Have a private conversation immediately to understand why the issue recurred
D) Send an email detailing the mistake for documentation purposes

✅ Correct Answer: C
Why: Feedback should be timely and delivered privately for issues. Understanding "why" addresses root cause—maybe the previous feedback wasn't clear, they need training, or there's a systemic issue.

❌ Why Others Are Wrong:
- A: Waiting for annual review is too late; feedback loses impact
- B: Escalating before direct conversation is premature
- D: Email is impersonal and doesn't allow for dialogue

---

Sample Question 2: Recognition Method

"A team member volunteered to mentor a struggling colleague, spending extra hours helping them improve. The mentoring was successful—the struggling colleague is now performing well. How should you recognize the mentor?"

A) Include it in their next performance review
B) Thank them privately and ask if they'd like public recognition
C) Give them a bonus immediately
D) Publicly praise them in the next team meeting

✅ Correct Answer: B
Why: Recognition should be timely (not wait for review) and match the person's preference. Some people prefer public recognition; others find it uncomfortable. Asking respects their preference.

❌ Why Others Are Wrong:
- A: Too delayed; loses impact
- C: PM may not have authority for bonuses; assumes money is the motivator
- D: Doesn't consider their preference; may embarrass them

---

Sample Question 3: Addressing Underperformance

"A developer who was previously a strong performer has been missing deadlines and producing lower quality work for the past 3 weeks. What should the PM do FIRST?"

A) Place them on a formal performance improvement plan
B) Reassign their work to other team members to maintain project schedule
C) Have a private conversation to understand what's happening
D) Notify their functional manager about the performance decline

✅ Correct Answer: C
Why: Always investigate before acting. The decline could be due to personal issues, unclear requirements, skill gaps on new technology, or burnout. Understanding the cause determines the right solution.

❌ Why Others Are Wrong:
- A: PIP is premature without understanding the cause
- B: Doesn't address the issue; may demotivate them further
- D: Escalating before having a direct conversation is premature

---

Sample Question 4: Constructive Feedback

"You need to give feedback to a team member whose code consistently has bugs that slip through to production. What's the BEST approach?"

A) "You need to be more careful. Your bugs are causing problems."
B) "In the last 3 sprints, we've had 12 bugs from your code reach production, which required 40 hours of emergency fixes and impacted customer trust. Let's discuss how we can improve quality."
C) "Everyone makes mistakes, don't worry about it."
D) "I'm putting you on a quality improvement plan effective immediately."

✅ Correct Answer: B
Why: This uses SBI model—Situation (last 3 sprints), Behavior (12 bugs reached production), Impact (40 hours fixes, customer trust). It's specific, factual, and opens dialogue for improvement.

❌ Why Others Are Wrong:
- A: Vague, judgmental ("more careful"), not actionable
- C: Avoids the issue; doesn't help them improve
- D: Punitive without dialogue; doesn't seek understanding

---

Sample Question 5: Recognizing Team vs Individual

"The project team just delivered a critical milestone ahead of schedule. The success was due to collaborative effort, though one team member contributed exceptionally. How should you handle recognition?"

A) Recognize only the exceptional individual to motivate others
B) Recognize the team as a whole, then separately acknowledge the exceptional contributor
C) Recognize only the team to avoid creating competition
D) Let the team self-select who should be recognized

✅ Correct Answer: B
Why: Both team and individual contributions deserve recognition. Recognizing only the team ignores exceptional effort; recognizing only the individual can damage team dynamics.

❌ Why Others Are Wrong:
- A: Undermines team collaboration; creates unhealthy competition
- C: Fails to recognize exceptional individual contribution
- D: May create awkwardness; PM responsibility to recognize

Support Team Performance
Deep Dive

Comprehensive Guide to Supporting Team Performance

Introduction

Supporting team performance is one of the most nuanced competencies for project managers. Unlike functional managers who have formal authority over team members' careers, project managers must influence performance through feedback, coaching, recognition, and creating environments where people can excel. This deep dive explores the frameworks, techniques, and best practices that enable project managers to maximize team performance.

---

## Part 1: The Performance Support Framework

### Understanding Your Role

Project managers typically don't have formal authority over team members' performance reviews, compensation, or career progression. This creates a unique challenge: how do you improve performance without traditional management levers?

**The PM's Performance Toolkit:**
1. **Feedback** - Regular, specific, actionable input on performance
2. **Recognition** - Acknowledging and celebrating contributions
3. **Development** - Providing growth opportunities
4. **Coaching** - Helping team members improve
5. **Environment** - Creating conditions for success
6. **Advocacy** - Championing team members with functional managers

### The Performance Equation

```
Performance = Ability × Motivation × Opportunity
```

- **Ability**: Skills, knowledge, competencies
- **Motivation**: Willingness, engagement, drive
- **Opportunity**: Resources, environment, support

When performance declines, diagnose which factor is the cause before selecting an intervention:

| Factor | Symptoms | Intervention |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| Ability Gap | Makes mistakes, asks many questions | Training, mentoring, pair work |
| Motivation Issue | Disengaged, minimal effort, late | Recognition, meaningful work, address concerns |
| Opportunity Blocker | Complains about obstacles, waits often | Remove impediments, provide resources |

---

## Part 2: The SBI Feedback Model

### What is SBI?

SBI (Situation-Behavior-Impact) is the gold standard for delivering feedback. It keeps feedback objective, specific, and actionable.

**S - Situation**
- When and where did the behavior occur?
- Be specific about time and place
- Creates shared context

**B - Behavior**
- What specific, observable behavior occurred?
- Focus on actions, not personality
- Avoid interpretations or judgments

**I - Impact**
- What was the effect of the behavior?
- On the project, team, stakeholders, customer
- Connect behavior to outcomes

### SBI Examples

**Constructive Feedback Example:**

❌ **Bad**: "You're always unprepared for meetings."

✅ **Good SBI**: 
- **S**: "In yesterday's client demo..."
- **B**: "...you presented the feature without testing it first, and it crashed twice..."
- **I**: "...which made the client question our quality practices and delayed their sign-off decision by a week."

**Positive Feedback Example:**

❌ **Bad**: "Great job on the project."

✅ **Good SBI**:
- **S**: "During last week's production incident..."
- **B**: "...you immediately took ownership, coordinated the response team, and communicated updates every 30 minutes to stakeholders..."
- **I**: "...which kept everyone calm, reduced resolution time by 2 hours, and the client specifically praised our incident response."

### SBI Delivery Tips

1. **Prepare**: Write out your SBI before the conversation
2. **Private Setting**: Constructive feedback always in private
3. **Timely**: Deliver as close to the event as possible
4. **Two-Way**: After delivering SBI, ask for their perspective
5. **Action-Oriented**: End with "What can we do differently next time?"

---

## Part 3: Recognition Strategies

### Why Recognition Matters

Research consistently shows that recognition is one of the most powerful performance drivers:
- 69% of employees would work harder if better recognized
- Recognition is the #1 driver of great work
- Lack of recognition is a top reason people leave jobs

### Types of Recognition

**By Formality:**

| Type | Examples | Best For |
|------|----------|----------|
| Formal | Awards, bonuses, promotions, certificates | Major achievements, milestone completions |
| Informal | Verbal praise, thank-you notes, shout-outs | Daily contributions, effort, improvement |

**By Visibility:**

| Type | Examples | Best For |
|------|----------|----------|
| Public | Team meeting recognition, company announcements | People who prefer visibility, team wins |
| Private | 1-on-1 praise, personal notes | Introverts, personal achievements |

### The Recognition Framework

**T.A.P.S. Model:**

- **T - Timely**: Recognize as close to the event as possible
- **A - Authentic**: Be genuine; people detect fake praise
- **P - Personal**: Match recognition to individual preferences
- **S - Specific**: State exactly what they did and why it mattered

### Recognition Best Practices

**Ask About Preferences**
At project start or in 1-on-1s, ask:
- "How do you prefer to receive recognition?"
- "Are you comfortable with public recognition?"
- "What types of recognition are most meaningful to you?"

**Recognize Different Things**
- **Results**: Achieving goals, deliverables, outcomes
- **Effort**: Hard work, extra hours, persistence
- **Improvement**: Growth, learning, skill development
- **Behaviors**: Collaboration, helping others, initiative
- **Ideas**: Innovation, problem-solving, suggestions

**Avoid Recognition Mistakes**
- Generic praise ("Good job") without specifics
- Recognizing only top performers (demotivates others)
- Public recognition for those who prefer private
- Delayed recognition (loses impact)
- Recognizing only results, not effort

---

## Part 4: Addressing Underperformance

### The Underperformance Process

**Step 1: Identify the Issue**
- What specific behaviors or outcomes are below expectations?
- How does it compare to past performance or peers?
- Is it consistent or situational?

**Step 2: Investigate Root Causes**
Before assuming the worst, explore:
- Personal issues (health, family, stress)
- Work issues (unclear expectations, inadequate resources)
- Skill gaps (new technology, changed requirements)
- Motivation issues (disengagement, burnout, conflict)
- Systemic issues (process problems, dependencies)

**Step 3: Have the Conversation**

Structure:
1. **Open**: "I want to discuss some observations and hear your perspective."
2. **Share**: Use SBI to describe specific performance gaps
3. **Listen**: "What's been happening from your perspective?"
4. **Explore**: "What do you think is contributing to this?"
5. **Plan**: "What can we do to address this together?"
6. **Commit**: "Let's agree on specific actions and check in again on [date]."

**Step 4: Create Improvement Plan**
- Specific, measurable goals
- Timeline for improvement
- Resources and support provided
- Check-in frequency
- Consequences if no improvement (be honest)

**Step 5: Follow Up**
- Monitor progress against plan
- Provide feedback during improvement period
- Recognize improvements
- Document conversations

**Step 6: Escalate if Necessary**
If improvement doesn't occur despite support:
- Document all coaching attempts
- Involve functional manager
- Consider reassignment or removal from project

### Coaching vs. Corrective Action

**Coaching** (First Response)
- Collaborative approach
- Focus on development
- Future-oriented
- Trust-building

**Counseling** (Escalation)
- More directive
- Focus on specific issues
- Sets clear expectations
- Documents concerns

**Corrective Action** (Last Resort)
- Formal process
- Clear consequences
- Documentation required
- HR involvement

### The Underperformance Conversation

**What to Say:**

"Alex, I want to have a candid conversation with you. Over the past three sprints, I've noticed that the features you've delivered have required significant rework—averaging about 40% revision after code review. This is causing delays for the team and extra work for reviewers.

I want to understand what's happening from your perspective. Is there something going on that I should know about? Are there obstacles or gaps I can help address?

What I'd like is for us to work together on a plan to get things back on track. I believe you can do great work—I've seen it before—and I want to support you in getting there."

**What NOT to Say:**

"Your work has been terrible lately. You need to do better or there will be consequences. I don't know what's wrong with you."

---

## Part 5: Development and Growth

### The Development Mindset

Great project managers see performance issues as development opportunities, not character flaws. This mindset:
- Assumes people want to succeed
- Focuses on capability building
- Creates psychological safety
- Improves long-term performance

### Creating Development Plans

**Components:**
1. **Current State**: Where are they now?
2. **Desired State**: Where do they need to be?
3. **Gap Analysis**: What's missing?
4. **Development Activities**: How will they get there?
5. **Timeline**: By when?
6. **Support**: What help will you provide?
7. **Measurement**: How will progress be tracked?

**Development Activities:**
- Training courses
- Mentoring relationships
- Stretch assignments
- Pair work with experts
- Self-study resources
- Conference attendance
- Certification programs
- Job shadowing

### Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory

Understanding what motivates people helps you support performance:

**Hygiene Factors** (Prevent Dissatisfaction):
- Salary
- Job security
- Working conditions
- Company policies
- Relationships with colleagues

**Motivators** (Create Satisfaction):
- Achievement
- Recognition
- The work itself
- Responsibility
- Advancement
- Growth

**Implication**: Fixing hygiene factors won't motivate—but ignoring them will demotivate. True motivation comes from meaningful work, recognition, and growth opportunities.

---

## Part 6: Performance Metrics

### What to Measure

**Output Metrics:**
- Deliverables completed
- Features shipped
- Bugs fixed
- Stories closed

**Quality Metrics:**
- Defect rates
- Rework percentage
- Customer satisfaction
- Code review feedback

**Process Metrics:**
- Velocity trends
- Estimation accuracy
- Meeting commitments
- Response times

**Collaboration Metrics:**
- Team member feedback
- Cross-functional cooperation
- Knowledge sharing
- Helping others

### Measurement Best Practices

**Do:**
- Measure outcomes, not just activities
- Use multiple metrics (avoid single-point failure)
- Make metrics visible and transparent
- Discuss metrics in context
- Focus on trends, not single data points

**Don't:**
- Use metrics punitively
- Compare individuals publicly
- Measure things people can't control
- Create gaming behavior through bad metrics
- Ignore context when interpreting metrics

---

## Part 7: Integration with Other Tasks

### Connection to Task 2: Lead a Team
- Leadership style affects how feedback is received
- Tuckman stages influence performance patterns
- Servant leadership means developing people

### Connection to Task 4: Empower Team Members
- Empowerment requires capability
- Performance support builds capability
- Recognition reinforces empowered behavior

### Connection to Task 5: Ensure Training
- Skill gaps identified through performance support
- Training addresses ability component of performance equation
- Development plans often include formal training

### Connection to Task 7: Remove Impediments
- Performance issues may be caused by impediments
- Investigate before assuming individual fault
- System problems require systemic solutions

---

## Summary: Key Principles

1. **Performance = Ability × Motivation × Opportunity** - Diagnose before prescribing
2. **SBI** - Situation, Behavior, Impact for all feedback
3. **Timely** - Feedback and recognition close to the event
4. **Private for Problems** - Constructive feedback always in private
5. **Investigate First** - Understand root causes before acting
6. **Development Focus** - Build capabilities, don't just fix problems
7. **Recognition Matters** - Specific, timely, matched to preferences
8. **Document** - Keep records of coaching conversations
9. **Escalate Appropriately** - After direct coaching attempts
10. **Servant Leadership** - Your job is to help them succeed

## Scenario 1: The Declining Performer

### Situation

Sarah has been on your agile development team for 8 months. For the first 6 months, she was a strong performer—consistently delivering quality work on time, actively participating in ceremonies, and helping teammates.

Over the past 2 months, you've noticed:
- She's completed 40% fewer story points
- Code quality has declined (defect rate doubled)
- She's quieter in meetings
- She arrives late and leaves early several times per week
- She declined to help a junior developer who asked for assistance

Her functional manager mentioned nothing during your last sync.

**What should you do FIRST?**

A) Place Sarah on a formal performance improvement plan to document the issues
B) Reassign her work to other team members to protect the project schedule
C) Schedule a private 1-on-1 to express concern and understand what's happening
D) Notify her functional manager about the performance decline
E) Continue monitoring for another 2 weeks to gather more data

### Correct Answer: C

**Why C is correct:**
The sudden change from strong to declining performance signals something changed. Before taking any action, you need to understand the root cause. A private conversation allows you to express concern (not accusation), learn her perspective, and determine the right intervention. It could be personal issues, burnout, conflict with a colleague, health problems, or dissatisfaction with work—each requiring different responses.

**Why others are wrong:**
- **A**: PIP is premature without understanding the cause—it's punitive when she might need support
- **B**: Doesn't address the issue and may embarrass or further demotivate her
- **D**: Escalating before direct conversation is inappropriate—try coaching first
- **E**: Two months of decline is enough data; waiting further delays necessary support

**Key Principle:** Always investigate root causes before determining interventions. Performance = Ability × Motivation × Opportunity—you must diagnose which factor is affected.

---

## Scenario 2: The Feedback Request

### Situation

During a 1-on-1, Marcus, a mid-level developer on your team, asks: "I've been here for a year now. I feel like I'm doing well, but I never get any feedback. How am I actually performing? What should I be working on?"

You realize you haven't given Marcus much feedback—he's a solid performer who doesn't create problems, so he's been easy to overlook.

**How should you respond?**

A) "You're doing great, Marcus. Keep up the good work!"
B) "Let me think about it and get back to you next week with specific feedback."
C) "In [specific situation], I noticed [specific behavior], which had [specific impact]. That's an example of what you do well. For growth, I'd like to see [specific development area]. Let's discuss both."
D) "That's really your functional manager's job. You should ask them."

### Correct Answer: C

**Why C is correct:**
Marcus deserves specific, actionable feedback using the SBI model. He asked because he wants to grow, not just hear "you're doing fine." Providing specific positive examples validates his strengths, while identifying a growth area shows you're invested in his development. Solid performers often get overlooked—this conversation can increase his engagement.

**Why others are wrong:**
- **A**: Vague and unhelpful; doesn't answer his question or help him grow
- **B**: Delays what should be ongoing; you should be prepared with feedback
- **D**: Abdicates PM responsibility; you observe his work daily and owe him feedback

**Key Principle:** Solid performers deserve feedback too. Don't let "no news is good news" become your default—proactive feedback builds engagement.

## Scenario 3: The Public Mistake

### Situation

During the sprint demo with key stakeholders, Jamie (a developer) presented a feature. Midway through, a significant bug caused the demo to crash. Jamie tried to recover but became flustered. After two more attempts with failures, you stepped in and ended the demo early.

The stakeholders were visibly frustrated. Jamie is clearly embarrassed and upset. The team is quiet. It's 3 PM on Friday.

**What should you do?**

A) Send an email to the team analyzing what went wrong so it doesn't happen again
B) Have a private conversation with Jamie acknowledging the difficulty, then work together to plan next steps
C) Call a team meeting to debrief and create new demo procedures
D) Wait until Monday—everyone needs the weekend to cool off

### Correct Answer: B

**Why B is correct:**
Jamie is embarrassed and upset. Immediate private support shows you care about them as a person, not just the failure. The conversation should acknowledge the difficulty ("That was tough, I know"), ask about their well-being, and collaboratively plan recovery (not blame). Public critique would humiliate them further. Waiting until Monday leaves them stewing all weekend.

**Why others are wrong:**
- **A**: Public analysis feels like blame; focuses on the failure, not the person
- **C**: Team meeting makes Jamie the center of attention for a failure; humiliating
- **D**: Leaves Jamie anxious and embarrassed all weekend; shows you don't care

**Key Principle:** After public failures, provide private support first. Address the person before the problem.

---

## Scenario 4: The Recognition Decision

### Situation

Your team just completed a challenging milestone—a major platform migration that was on time and under budget. The success was truly a team effort, though two people stood out:
- **Elena**: Technical lead who designed the architecture and solved the hardest problems
- **Chris**: Coordinated stakeholder communication and kept everyone aligned

Your company has one "Star Performer" award to give for the quarter.

**What should you do?**

A) Give the award to Elena since the technical work was most critical
B) Give the award to Chris since communication is often undervalued
C) Nominate the entire team for the award
D) Recognize the team publicly and acknowledge Elena and Chris specifically, then discuss the award nomination separately with each

### Correct Answer: D

**Why D is correct:**
Recognition should match contribution. The team deserves recognition for the collective achievement. Elena and Chris deserve individual acknowledgment for exceptional contributions. Forcing a single award on a team effort creates competition and may demotivate others. Recognizing everyone appropriately maintains team cohesion while honoring individual excellence.

**Why others are wrong:**
- **A & B**: Single-person award for team effort can damage team dynamics
- **C**: May not be possible per award rules; also dilutes exceptional individual contributions

**Key Principle:** Recognize at the appropriate level. Team wins deserve team recognition. Individual excellence deserves individual recognition. Don't force one into the other.

---

## Scenario 5: The Repeated Mistake

### Situation

In your last 1-on-1 with Alex (3 weeks ago), you used SBI feedback to address code quality issues—specifically, bugs slipping through to production. Alex acknowledged the feedback and committed to improving.

Today, another bug from Alex's code reached production. This is the third incident since your conversation.

**What should you do?**

A) Have another private conversation exploring why improvement hasn't occurred and co-create a more specific improvement plan
B) Assign Alex's code reviews to more senior developers
C) Begin formal documentation for a performance improvement plan
D) Ask Alex's functional manager to address the issue

### Correct Answer: A

**Why A is correct:**
Coaching is iterative. The initial feedback may not have been specific enough, there may be underlying issues you didn't uncover, or Alex may need more support than verbal feedback provides. A second conversation should explore: What did you try? What got in the way? What support do you need? Then co-create a specific plan with clear actions, resources, and check-in dates.

**Why others are wrong:**
- **B**: Doesn't address the root cause; may demotivate Alex
- **C**: PIP is the next step if coaching fails, but one follow-up conversation isn't enough
- **D**: Escalating before exhausting your coaching options is premature

**Key Principle:** Coaching is iterative. If initial feedback doesn't work, dig deeper before escalating.

---

## Scenario 6: The High Performer Request

### Situation

Dana is your highest performer—consistently exceeds expectations, mentors others, and takes on the hardest work. In a 1-on-1, Dana says:

"I love this team, but I'm feeling stuck. I've been doing the same type of work for 18 months. I want to grow, but I don't see a path here. I've been contacted by recruiters, and I'm starting to listen."

**What should you do?**

A) Offer to advocate for a raise or promotion
B) Explore what growth means to Dana, then work together to find or create development opportunities
C) Remind Dana how valuable they are and hope that's enough
D) Accept that high performers eventually leave and begin succession planning

### Correct Answer: B

**Why B is correct:**
Dana isn't asking for money—they're asking for growth. Understanding what "growth" means to Dana (new challenges? Leadership? New technology? Visibility?) allows you to address the real need. Then collaborate on solutions: stretch assignments, leading initiatives, representing the team externally, mentoring programs, rotation to other teams. Retain talent by developing talent.

**Why others are wrong:**
- **A**: Assumes money/title is the issue; it's not what Dana asked for
- **C**: Platitudes without action; Dana will leave
- **D**: Gives up without trying; high performers CAN be retained through development

**Key Principle:** Retention comes from development. When top performers signal flight risk, understand their needs and create growth opportunities.

---

## Scenario 7: The New Team Member

### Situation

Jordan just joined your team 4 weeks ago. They're experienced (10 years in the industry) but new to your company's technology stack and processes.

You've noticed:
- They ask many questions (some basic)
- Deliveries take longer than veterans
- Quality is good when they deliver
- They seem hesitant to commit to sprint goals

**How should you approach Jordan's performance?**

A) Give them the same expectations as veteran team members—they're experienced
B) Provide extra support, adjust expectations, pair them with a mentor, and recognize progress
C) Wait 90 days before evaluating—standard onboarding period
D) Give feedback that they need to speed up to meet team standards

### Correct Answer: B

**Why B is correct:**
Jordan is experienced but new to context. Performance = Ability × Motivation × Opportunity. Their ability is being rebuilt in a new environment. Appropriate support includes: adjusted expectations, pairing with a mentor, providing learning resources, and recognizing progress (not just comparing to veterans). The hesitancy on sprint goals shows self-awareness, not weakness.

**Why others are wrong:**
- **A**: Ignores context; sets them up to fail; unfair comparison
- **C**: 90 days without feedback leaves them anxious and unsupported
- **D**: Pressure without support; may cause defensive behavior

**Key Principle:** New team members need calibrated expectations and extra support. Judge progress, not absolute performance.

---

## Summary: Key Takeaways

| Situation | Right Approach |
|-----------|----------------|
| Performance decline | Investigate root cause first |
| No feedback given | Provide specific SBI feedback proactively |
| Public failure | Private support before problem analysis |
| Team success | Recognize at appropriate levels (team + individual) |
| Repeated issue | Deeper coaching conversation before escalating |
| High performer flight risk | Understand and address development needs |
| New team member | Calibrated expectations with extra support |

## How to Use This Activity

1. Read each artifact carefully
2. Identify performance signals (positive and negative)
3. Determine appropriate PM response
4. Compare with analysis

## Document 1: Sprint Velocity Data

**VELOCITY CHART - TEAM ALPHA (Last 6 Sprints)**

```
Sprint 12: 34 points ████████████████████████████████████
Sprint 13: 36 points ██████████████████████████████████████
Sprint 14: 38 points ████████████████████████████████████████

### Your Analysis

**What patterns do you see?**
[Space for your analysis]

**What should the PM investigate?**
[Space for your analysis]

---

### Document Detective Analysis

**Observable Patterns:**
1. **Steady improvement** (Sprints 12-14): +4 points over 3 sprints
2. **Sharp decline starts Sprint 15**: -10 points (26% drop)
3. **Continued decline**: Sprint 16 (-4), Sprint 17 (-2)
4. **Correlation**: Jordan's PTO aligns with initial decline

**Red Flags:**
- Decline continued AFTER Jordan returned (Sprint 16, 17)
- Team composition unchanged = not a staffing issue
- Pattern suggests systemic or team-wide issue, not individual

**PM Should Investigate:**
1. Did something change at Sprint 15? (New technology? Requirements change? Team conflict?)
2. Is Jordan's return masking something? (Maybe they returned disengaged)
3. Are individual contributions visible? (Who specifically is declining?)
4. Is this a burnout pattern after Sprint 14's peak?

**Appropriate Response:**
- Don't assume Jordan's PTO is the cause (correlation ≠ causation)
- Have team retrospective focused on what changed
- Look at individual-level data if available
- Have 1-on-1s to check in on team member well-being

## Document 2: Slack Message Thread

**#team-alpha channel**

**Monday 9:15 AM - Sam:**
> Hey team, stuck on the authentication module. Anyone available to pair?

**Monday 11:42 AM - Sam:**
> Still stuck. @Maya @Jordan anyone?

**Monday 2:30 PM - Maya:**
> Sorry Sam, swamped with the reporting feature. Maybe try Stack Overflow?

**Monday 4:45 PM - Sam:**
> Figured it out after 6 hours. Moving on.

**Tuesday 9:00 AM - PM (you):**
> Great work getting unblocked Sam! 💪

### Your Analysis

**What performance signals do you see?**
[Space for your analysis]

**What recognition or feedback is needed?**
[Space for your analysis]

---

### Document Detective Analysis

**Signals Identified:**

**Sam (Mixed):**
- ✅ Showed initiative asking for help
- ✅ Persisted and solved problem independently
- ⚠️ Lost 6 hours that pair programming could have saved
- ⚠️ May feel unsupported

**Maya (Concern):**
- ⚠️ Delayed response (5 hours to reply)
- ⚠️ Deflected rather than helped
- ⚠️ "Stack Overflow" suggestion feels dismissive
- ❓ Is Maya actually swamped, or avoiding collaboration?

**Team Culture:**
- ⚠️ Junior developer left struggling for 6 hours
- ⚠️ Only one response from entire team
- ⚠️ PM's response, while positive, missed the real issue

**Feedback Needed:**

1. **To Sam (Private, Positive + Developmental):**
   "I saw you spent 6 hours working through that auth issue. I appreciate your persistence in figuring it out. In the future, if you're blocked for more than an hour, please escalate to me—it's my job to help remove blockers. How can I better support you?"

2. **To Maya (Private, Curious Not Accusatory):**
   "I noticed Sam was blocked for most of Monday. I want to understand your workload—are you overloaded? How can we balance delivery with team support?"

3. **To Team (Retrospective Topic):**
   Discuss team collaboration norms. How quickly should we respond to help requests? What's acceptable time-to-unblock?

**PM Self-Reflection:**
- The "Great work!" response was tone-deaf—Sam struggled for 6 hours
- Should have addressed the support failure, not just celebrated the outcome

## Document 3: Performance Review Notes

**DRAFT - Alex Chen Performance Notes**
**Prepared by: Functional Manager**
**For: Mid-year check-in**

```
Alex Chen - Software Developer
Tenure: 14 months

Strengths:
- Reliable attendance
- Completes assigned work
- No complaints from teammates

Areas for Development:
- Rarely volunteers for challenging work
- Doesn't contribute ideas in planning
- Basic communication - updates only when asked

Performance Rating: "Meets Expectations"

Recommendation: Continue current trajectory
```

---

### Your Analysis

**What performance patterns do you see?**
[Space for your analysis]

**What feedback approach would you recommend?**
[Space for your analysis]

---

### Document Detective Analysis

**Pattern Recognition:**

This describes a **"quiet contributor"** who:
- Does what's asked but nothing more
- Doesn't create problems but doesn't excel
- May be disengaged, risk-averse, or under-challenged

**Warning Signs:**
- "No complaints from teammates" = damning with faint praise
- "Basic communication" suggests disengagement
- "Rarely volunteers" = possible motivation or confidence issue
- Functional manager's "continue current trajectory" = no growth focus

**Root Cause Hypotheses:**
1. **Disengagement**: Alex is checked out but staying for paycheck
2. **Risk aversion**: Burned before; now plays it safe
3. **Under-challenged**: Bored, not stimulated
4. **Unclear expectations**: Doesn't know more is expected
5. **Introversion**: Capable but not self-promoting

**PM Approach:**

**1-on-1 Conversation Focus:**
- "Alex, I want to understand your experience on this team."
- "What parts of the work energize you? What drains you?"
- "Where do you see yourself in 2 years? What would help you get there?"
- "I'd like to see you take on more challenging work. What would make that comfortable for you?"

**Development vs. Acceptance:**
Don't accept "meets expectations" as end state. A PM's job is to develop team members, not just utilize them.

## Document 4: Email Chain

**Subject: RE: Sprint 18 Commitment**

**From: Taylor (QA)**
**To: You (PM)**
**CC: Maya, Jordan, Alex, Sam**

---

PM,

I want to flag that we're overcommitting AGAIN. We said 32 points this sprint but we haven't completed more than 24 in two months.

I've raised this in planning three times. Each time, we commit high and miss. Each time, I feel like nobody listens. Now I'm on record via email.

When we miss sprint goals:
- Stakeholders lose trust
- QA gets crushed at end of sprint
- I find bugs that should've been caught earlier

I don't want to be negative, but something needs to change.

Taylor

### Your Analysis

**What performance signals do you see?**
[Space for your analysis]

**What is your response?**
[Space for your analysis]

---

### Document Detective Analysis

**Signal Analysis:**

**Taylor's Behavior:**
- ✅ Appropriately raised concern
- ✅ Provided evidence (3 times, specific patterns)
- ⚠️ Escalated to email because verbal wasn't working
- ⚠️ Copied entire team = frustration/public pressure
- ⚠️ "On record" language = protecting themselves

**Underlying Issues:**
1. Team repeatedly overcommits (planning problem)
2. Taylor's input ignored in planning (inclusion problem)
3. QA crushed at end of sprint (process problem)
4. Taylor feels unheard (psychological safety problem)

**Recognition Needed:**
Taylor is demonstrating courage and care for the team. This should be acknowledged, not punished.

**PM Response:**

**Step 1: Private conversation with Taylor**
"Thank you for this email. You're right to raise it, and I hear your frustration. I want to address this seriously. Can we meet privately to discuss?"

**Step 2: Acknowledge and validate**
"You've raised this three times and felt unheard. That's a failure on my part to create a space where your input is valued. I'm sorry."

**Step 3: Take action**
- Review commitment process
- Give Taylor formal voice in sprint capacity
- Address QA timing in sprint

**Step 4: Recognize Taylor (appropriately)**
After changes are made, acknowledge Taylor's role in improving the team—but privately first, asking if they want public recognition.

## Document 5: Meeting Notes

**RETROSPECTIVE NOTES - Sprint 17**

**What Went Well:**
- Deployed without production issues
- New CI/CD pipeline working
- Jordan's architecture design approved

**What Didn't Go Well:**
- Missed sprint goal (again)
- Maya out sick 3 days
- Last-minute requirements change from stakeholders
- "Nobody reads my pull request comments" - Alex

**Action Items:**
- [None captured]

---

### Your Analysis

**What performance insights can you extract?**
[Space for your analysis]

**What follow-up is needed?**
[Space for your analysis]

---

### Document Detective Analysis

**Red Flags:**

1. **"Missed sprint goal (again)"**
   - "Again" signals pattern, not incident
   - Team aware but not addressing

2. **Maya out sick 3 days**
   - Is this related to previous workload concerns?
   - Burnout indicator?

3. **"Nobody reads my pull request comments" - Alex**
   - This is significant! Alex IS contributing (code reviews)
   - Feels unheard/ignored
   - Connects to "doesn't contribute ideas" from performance review

4. **No action items**
   - Retrospective identified issues but no commitment to change
   - Learned helplessness: "We raise things but nothing changes"

**Follow-Up Needed:**

1. **With Alex (Priority):**
   "In the retro, you mentioned PR comments go unread. Tell me more. What examples? How does that feel?"
   
   This could be the key to engaging Alex. They ARE contributing; they just feel ignored.

2. **With Maya:**
   Check in on workload and wellness. Three sick days after being "swamped" may indicate burnout.

3. **With Team:**
   Retrospective actions must happen. Schedule follow-up on sprint goal patterns.

4. **Process Change:**
   Implement PR comment SLA or review process.

## Summary: Document Detective Skills

When analyzing project artifacts, look for:

| Signal Type | Examples | PM Response |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| Performance decline | Velocity drop, missed commitments | Investigate root cause |
| Collaboration gaps | Delayed help, ignored requests | Address team norms |
| Unheard voices | Repeated concerns, "on record" language | Create psychological safety |
| Hidden contributions | PR comments, behind-scenes work | Recognize invisible work |
| Burnout indicators | Sick time, disengagement, cynicism | Check in on wellness |
| Pattern vs incident | "Again," repeated themes | Address systemically |

Sequence a Performance Journey Through 12 Months

Welcome to Timeline Reconstructor! In this activity, you'll arrange scrambled events from a 12-month performance story into chronological order, identify performance patterns, and analyze how PM interventions affected outcomes.

---

## The Scenario: Alex's Performance Journey

**Context:** Alex joined Team Phoenix as a mid-level developer. Over 12 months, their performance went through distinct phases. Your job is to sequence these events and identify what the PM did right, wrong, and what they learned.

**Team:** 6-person agile team
**Project:** Customer portal modernization
**PM Style:** Learning servant leadership

---

## SCRAMBLED EVENTS

Arrange these 15 events in chronological order:

---

**Event A:**
> Alex asks to lead the security module redesign—the most complex component. PM hesitates but agrees with extra check-ins.

**Event B:**
> PM notices Alex arrives late three times in one week and seems distracted in standups. PM thinks, "Probably just a rough week."

**Event C:**
> Alex delivers security module on time with zero critical bugs. QA praises the thoroughness. PM recognizes Alex publicly in sprint review.

**Event D:**
> Sprint retrospective: Alex says "I don't feel like my work matters here. I fix bugs nobody notices and my ideas get ignored."

**Event E:**
> Alex joins the team. First sprint: completes all assigned stories, attends all ceremonies, asks good questions. PM thinks, "Solid hire."

**Event F:**
> PM finally has 1-on-1 with Alex after noticing 4 weeks of declining output. Alex reveals they've been interviewing elsewhere. "I've felt invisible here for months."

**Event G:**
> Alex's code review of junior developer's work catches a critical flaw that would have caused data loss. PM learns about it through Slack, not Alex.

**Event H:**
> PM creates development plan with Alex focused on technical leadership path. Includes leading code reviews, mentoring junior devs, and architecture involvement.

**Event I:**
> During planning, Alex suggests a better approach to the API integration. Senior dev dismisses it. PM doesn't intervene. Alex is quiet for the rest of the meeting.

**Event J:**
> Alex's velocity drops 30% from previous quarter. PM attributes it to "harder stories" without investigating.

**Event K:**
> PM recognizes Alex privately for code review catch: "Your review prevented a major incident. That kind of vigilance is exactly what we need." Alex seems surprised anyone noticed.

**Event L:**
> Three months in, PM realizes they've never had a 1-on-1 with Alex. "They're doing fine, no fires to fight."

**Event M:**
> Alex considers declining the security module offer: "Last time I suggested something, it got shot down." PM asks what would make them comfortable taking it on.

**Event N:**
> Alex becomes informal mentor to two junior developers. They specifically request Alex for code reviews.

**Event O:**
> Alex turns down an external offer and commits to staying. "This is the first time I've felt seen and developed here."

**O** → Alex turns down an external offer and commits to staying. "This is the first time I've felt seen and developed here."

---

## TIMELINE ANALYSIS

### Phase 1: Neglected Solid Performer (Months 1-5)

**Events:** E → L → I → G → D

**Pattern:** Alex performed well but received no attention. PM focused on "fires" and neglected solid contributors.

**PM Mistakes:**
- No 1-on-1s with performing team member
- Didn't intervene when Alex's idea was dismissed
- Missed opportunity to recognize code review catch
- Allowed Alex's contribution to become invisible

**Lesson:** *Solid performers need attention too. Absence of problems ≠ presence of engagement.*

---

### Phase 2: Visible Decline (Months 6-8)

**Events:** B → J → F

**Pattern:** Classic disengagement spiral. Early warning signs ignored until performance declined significantly.

**PM Mistakes:**
- Dismissed behavioral changes as "rough week"
- Attributed velocity decline to external factors without investigating
- Waited 4+ weeks to have a conversation
- By Month 8, Alex was interviewing elsewhere

**Lesson:** *Investigate changes promptly. Don't explain away warning signs.*

---

### Phase 3: Recovery and Development (Months 9-12)

**Events:** K → H → A → M → C → N → O

**Pattern:** Intentional investment in recognition, development, and growth transformed the relationship.

**PM Actions That Worked:**
- Private recognition for past contribution (K)
- Collaborative development plan (H)
- Stretch opportunity with support (A)
- Addressed fear from past experience (M)
- Public recognition for success (C)
- Enabled mentoring role (N)

**Lesson:** *It's not too late to turn things around. Intentional investment in development and recognition rebuilds engagement.*

---

### The Turning Point

**Month 8 (Event F)** was the critical moment. Alex revealing they were interviewing could have gone two ways:

**Path A (What PM Did):**
Listened without defensiveness → Acknowledged failure → Created development plan → Invested in growth → Retained high performer

**Path B (What Could Have Happened):**
Got defensive → Made excuses → Did nothing different → Lost Alex to competitor

---

## REFLECTION QUESTIONS

1. **At what point could PM have prevented the decline?**
   - Earliest: Month 2 (start 1-on-1s)
   - Key moment: Month 3 (intervene when idea dismissed)
   - Wake-up call: Month 5 (retro feedback)

2. **What single change would have had the biggest impact?**
   - Regular 1-on-1s would have surfaced issues months earlier

3. **How does this story illustrate Performance = Ability × Motivation × Opportunity?**
   - Alex had Ability throughout
   - Motivation declined due to feeling invisible
   - PM eventually provided Opportunity (security module, mentoring)

4. **What performance support behaviors does this PM need to build as habits?**
   - Regular 1-on-1s with ALL team members
   - Proactive recognition (don't wait for fires)
   - Intervene when team members are dismissed
   - Investigate changes promptly

---

## KEY TAKEAWAYS

| Phase | What Happened | What Should Have Happened |
|-------|---------------|---------------------------|
| Months 1-5 | Neglected solid performer | Regular 1-on-1s, proactive recognition |
| Month 3 | Didn't intervene when idea dismissed | Protected psychological safety |
| Month 4 | Missed recognition opportunity | Thanked Alex immediately |
| Months 6-7 | Explained away warning signs | Investigated promptly |
| Month 8 | Almost too late | Listened, didn't get defensive |
| Months 9-12 | Invested intentionally | Maintained momentum |

Support Team Performance
Feedback Type Matcher

Match Situations to Appropriate Feedback Approaches

Welcome to Feedback Type Matcher! In this activity, you'll match workplace situations to the most appropriate feedback type, timing, and delivery method. This builds your ability to select the right approach for performance conversations.

---

## Feedback Types Reference

Before matching, review these feedback categories:

### By Purpose:
| Type | When to Use | Focus |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **Positive/Reinforcing** | Behavior you want repeated | Strengths, successes |
| **Constructive/Developmental** | Behavior that needs to change | Growth, improvement |
| **Coaching** | Building capability | Skills, development |
| **Corrective** | Addressing problems | Issues, consequences |

### By Timing:
| Type | When to Use | Advantage |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Immediate** | Right after event | Highest impact, clear connection |
| **Scheduled** | Regular 1-on-1s | Thoughtful, not reactive |
| **Periodic** | Monthly/quarterly reviews | Patterns, progress |
| **Event-based** | After projects/milestones | Context-specific |

### By Delivery:
| Type | When to Use | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Public** | Positive recognition | Team meeting shout-out |
| **Private** | Constructive feedback | 1-on-1 conversation |
| **Written** | Documentation needed | Email after verbal |
| **Verbal** | Most feedback | Direct conversation |

---

## MATCHING EXERCISE

For each situation, select:
1. Feedback PURPOSE
2. Feedback TIMING
3. Feedback DELIVERY

---

### Situation 1:
**Developer's code caused a production incident. They've already fixed it. This is the first time.**

**Best Match:**
- Purpose: **Constructive** (not punitive—first incident)
- Timing: **Same day, after resolution** (timely but not in crisis)
- Delivery: **Private verbal** (then document if needed)

**SBI Example:**
"After the release yesterday, your code change caused a 2-hour outage affecting 500 customers. I know you fixed it quickly. Let's discuss what we can do differently in testing to prevent this."

---

### Situation 2:
**Team member went above and beyond to help a colleague meet a deadline by staying late.**

**Best Match:**
- Purpose: **Positive/Reinforcing**
- Timing: **Immediate** (same or next day)
- Delivery: **Private first, ask about public** (respect preference)

**SBI Example:**
"Yesterday when Jordan was struggling to meet the deadline, you stayed late to help them finish. That collaboration allowed us to deliver on time and showed real team spirit. Would you be comfortable if I shared this in the sprint review?"

---

### Situation 3:
**Team member's work has been declining for 3 weeks. You've had one prior conversation with no improvement.**

**Best Match:**
- Purpose: **Corrective** (escalation from constructive)
- Timing: **Scheduled 1-on-1** (serious conversation needs dedicated time)
- Delivery: **Private, then documented**

**SBI Example:**
"Since our conversation three weeks ago, I've noticed the quality issues have continued—we've had 5 more bugs reach production. I want to understand what's getting in the way and create a specific improvement plan with clear milestones."

---

### Situation 4:
**Junior developer asks for feedback on their first major feature delivery.**

**Best Match:**
- Purpose: **Coaching** (developmental focus)
- Timing: **Scheduled shortly after delivery** (while fresh but not rushed)
- Delivery: **Private verbal** (safe space for growth discussion)

**SBI Example:**
"Your authentication feature shipped on time and passed all tests. That's a strong first major delivery. Let me share what I noticed went well: [specifics]. For growth, here's what to focus on next time: [specifics]."

---

### Situation 5:
**Team member publicly embarrassed a colleague by criticizing their work in a meeting.**

**Best Match:**
- Purpose: **Corrective** (behavior issue, not performance)
- Timing: **Same day, after meeting** (can't let it sit)
- Delivery: **Private verbal first**

**SBI Example:**
"In today's planning meeting, when you said 'that approach is completely wrong' in front of the team, Sarah looked visibly embarrassed and shut down for the rest of the meeting. We need to discuss how we give feedback on this team."

---

### Situation 6:
**High performer delivers consistent excellence quarter after quarter. You haven't said much because there are no issues.**

**Best Match:**
- Purpose: **Positive** (proactive recognition)
- Timing: **Now—don't wait** (you've been neglecting them)
- Delivery: **Private first, then public**

**SBI Example:**
"I realized I haven't told you this directly: for the past three quarters, you've consistently delivered the highest quality work on the team. Your architecture decisions have saved us weeks of rework. I want you to know I see it and value it."

---

### Situation 7:
**Team member has a skill gap that's slowing their work—not a motivation issue.**

**Best Match:**
- Purpose: **Coaching** (development, not criticism)
- Timing: **Scheduled 1-on-1** (needs thoughtful plan)
- Delivery: **Private verbal**

**SBI Example:**
"I've noticed the Kubernetes deployments take you longer than expected. That's totally normal—it's new technology for you. Let's create a development plan to build that skill. Would pairing with Maya for the next few deployments help?"

---

### Situation 8:
**Team successfully completed a challenging sprint with high collaboration.**

**Best Match:**
- Purpose: **Positive** (team recognition)
- Timing: **End of sprint/immediately** (don't wait)
- Delivery: **Public** (team achievement = team recognition)

**SBI Example:**
"Team, this sprint we faced unexpected scope changes mid-sprint and still delivered the core features. Everyone adjusted, helped each other, and stayed focused. That adaptability is exactly what high-performing teams do."

---

### Situation 9:
**You overheard a team member complaining about you to a colleague.**

**Best Match:**
- Purpose: **Curiosity first** (understand before responding)
- Timing: **After cooling off** (don't react emotionally)
- Delivery: **Private verbal**

**SBI Example:**
"I heard something about frustration with how I handled [situation]. I'd like to understand your perspective—can you help me understand what would have worked better?"

---

### Situation 10:
**New team member is struggling but hasn't asked for help—seems embarrassed.**

**Best Match:**
- Purpose: **Supportive/Coaching**
- Timing: **Proactive 1-on-1** (don't wait for them to ask)
- Delivery: **Private, low-pressure**

**SBI Example:**
"I remember when I was new—it's tough to know when to ask for help. I've noticed the sprint work is taking longer than expected. That's completely normal in a new environment. What would help you ramp up faster?"

---

## DECISION FRAMEWORK

When deciding feedback approach, ask:

```
1. What's the PURPOSE?
   - Reinforce? → Positive
   - Develop? → Coaching
   - Change behavior? → Constructive
   - Address serious issue? → Corrective

2. What's the TIMING?
   - How urgent?
   - How emotional?
   - How serious?
   - When is the person receptive?

3. What's the DELIVERY?
   - Positive + Person comfortable public? → Public
   - Constructive or corrective? → ALWAYS Private
   - Needs documentation? → Written follow-up
```

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

| Mistake | Problem | Better Approach |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Public corrective feedback | Humiliates, damages trust | Always private for issues |
| Delayed positive feedback | Loses impact | Recognize within 24 hours |
| Only negative feedback | Demotivates | Balance with recognition |
| Vague feedback | Not actionable | Use SBI for specifics |
| Feedback sandwich | Feels manipulative | Be direct and respectful |
| Assuming one approach fits all | Different people need different styles | Know your team members |
```

# TAB 9: TEAM MEMBER PERSPECTIVES (Empathy Exercise)

```markdown
← Back
Support Team Performance
Team Member Perspectives

Experience Feedback from the Receiving End

Welcome to Team Member Perspectives! In this activity, you'll experience performance feedback from the team member's point of view—understanding how different approaches feel and why delivery matters as much as content.

---

## How This Activity Works

You'll experience the SAME feedback delivered different ways. Notice how each version feels and what it makes you want to do.

---

## Scenario 1: The Bug in Production

**Context:** You're a developer. Your code caused a production bug that affected customers for 2 hours. You've already fixed it. Your PM asks to speak with you.

---

### Experience Version A:

Your PM says:
> "Your code broke production again. This is exactly the kind of carelessness I was worried about. We can't keep having these issues. I need you to be more careful. This affects the whole team's reputation. I'm documenting this conversation."

**How does this feel?**
[Space for reflection]

**What do you want to do next?**
[Space for reflection]

---

### Experience Version B:

Your PM says:
> "I saw the production issue earlier—I know you already fixed it, thank you for the quick response. I wanted to check in: what happened from your perspective? [listens] What do you think we could do differently in our process to catch this earlier? [listens] I appreciate you owning the fix quickly. Let's implement those process improvements you mentioned."

**How does this feel?**
[Space for reflection]

**What do you want to do next?**
[Space for reflection]

---

### Analysis: What's Different?

| Version A | Version B |
|-----------|-----------|
| Blaming ("your code broke") | Factual ("the production issue") |
| Judgmental ("carelessness") | Curious ("what happened?") |
| Past-focused ("again") | Future-focused ("what could we do differently?") |
| Threatening ("documenting this") | Collaborative ("let's implement") |
| PM as judge | PM as partner |

**Impact on Performance:**
- Version A: Defensive, resentful, may hide future issues, updates resume
- Version B: Accountable, engaged, suggests improvements, feels supported

---

## Scenario 2: The Invisible Contribution

**Context:** You're a developer who spends significant time reviewing others' code, catching bugs, and helping junior team members. Your deliverables are average because of this work. Performance review time approaches.

---

### Experience Version A:

Your PM says:
> "Looking at your velocity, you're below the team average. I need you to focus more on your own deliverables. The team needs everyone contributing at full capacity."

**How does this feel?**
[Space for reflection]

**What will you do differently?**
[Space for reflection]

---

### Experience Version B:

Your PM says:
> "I've been looking at team data, and I noticed something. Your individual velocity is below average, but I also see that you've done 40% of all code reviews and junior team members consistently request your help. That mentoring work doesn't show up in sprint points, but it's hugely valuable. How can we make sure you're recognized for both your delivery AND your team contributions? Should we adjust how we capture this work?"

**How does this feel?**
[Space for reflection]

**What will you do differently?**
[Space for reflection]

---

### Analysis: What's Different?

| Version A | Version B |
|-----------|-----------|
| Sees only metrics | Sees full contribution |
| Single measure | Multiple measures |
| Criticism | Recognition + curiosity |
| Demands change | Asks for input |
| Makes you feel invisible | Makes you feel seen |

**Impact on Performance:**
- Version A: Stop helping others, feel punished for team contribution, disengage
- Version B: Continue team contribution, feel valued, engage more deeply

---

## Scenario 3: The Public Recognition

**Context:** You're an introvert who prefers to work quietly. You just completed a significant technical achievement that saved the project weeks of work.

---

### Experience Version A:

In the team meeting, your PM says:
> "I want everyone to give a round of applause to Jordan! Jordan single-handedly solved our data migration problem and saved us three weeks! Jordan, stand up and tell everyone how you did it!"

All eyes turn to you. You feel your face flush.

**How does this feel?**
[Space for reflection]

---

### Experience Version B:

In a private 1-on-1, your PM says:
> "Jordan, your solution to the data migration problem was elegant and saved us three weeks. That's exactly the kind of technical leadership we need. I'd like to recognize this more broadly—what would feel comfortable to you? Would you prefer I mention it briefly in the sprint review, send a team Slack message, or just note it in my update to leadership?"

**How does this feel?**
[Space for reflection]

---

### Analysis: What's Different?

| Version A | Version B |
|-----------|-----------|
| Assumes everyone wants spotlight | Asks preference |
| Public without consent | Private first |
| Demands performance ("stand up, tell us") | Offers options |
| PM-centric ("I want everyone to...") | Person-centric ("what would feel comfortable?") |
| One-size-fits-all | Personalized approach |

**Impact on Performance:**
- Version A: Dread future recognition, may avoid standout work, feels anxious
- Version B: Feels respected, continues high performance, trusts PM

---

## Scenario 4: The Development Conversation

**Context:** You're a mid-level developer who's been on the team for 18 months. You feel stuck—same work, no growth, but no problems either. You're starting to wonder if you should look elsewhere.

---

### Experience Version A:

In your 1-on-1, your PM says:
> "Everything going okay? Good. Any blockers? No? Great. Let's keep up the good work."

**How does this feel?**
[Space for reflection]

---

### Experience Version B:

In your 1-on-1, your PM says:
> "You've been doing solid work for 18 months now, and I want to talk about what's next for you. Where do you see yourself in 2 years? What kind of work energizes you most? Are there skills you want to develop or projects you want to lead? I'd like to help create opportunities for growth—what would make this role more fulfilling for you?"

**How does this feel?**
[Space for reflection]

---

### Analysis: What's Different?

| Version A | Version B |
|-----------|-----------|
| Transactional check-in | Developmental conversation |
| No future focus | Explicit growth discussion |
| Assumes silence = satisfaction | Proactively explores engagement |
| PM is gatekeeper | PM is advocate |
| "Keep up good work" = stay in box | "What's next?" = grow |

**Impact on Performance:**
- Version A: Feel invisible, explore other options, disengage slowly
- Version B: Feel invested in, share aspirations, commit to staying

---

## Scenario 5: The Improvement Conversation

**Context:** Your work quality has been declining. You know it. You're struggling with personal issues at home but haven't told anyone. Your PM schedules a 1-on-1.

---

### Experience Version A:

Your PM says:
> "Your work quality has been unacceptable lately. You've had 7 bugs in the last 3 weeks. This is way below your previous standard. I need you to step it up immediately or we'll need to discuss a formal improvement plan."

**How does this feel?**
[Space for reflection]

**Will you share what's happening at home?**
[Space for reflection]

---

### Experience Version B:

Your PM says:
> "I've noticed a change in the last few weeks—more bugs than usual, which isn't like you. Before we talk about work, I want to check in: is everything okay? You seem off lately, and I want to make sure you're doing alright. [If you share] Thank you for telling me that. That sounds really difficult. Let's figure out how we can support you through this—what do you need right now?"

**How does this feel?**
[Space for reflection]

**Will you share what's happening at home?**
[Space for reflection]

---

### Analysis: What's Different?

| Version A | Version B |
|-----------|-----------|
| Leads with criticism | Leads with concern |
| Assumes fault | Investigates cause |
| Threatens consequences | Offers support |
| Transaction: "fix it or else" | Relationship: "how can I help?" |
| Closed to context | Open to context |

**Impact on Performance:**
- Version A: Hide personal issues, feel unsupported, stress increases, may lie
- Version B: Feel safe to share, accept support, performance recovers faster

---

## Key Lessons: What Team Members Need

From experiencing these perspectives:

### 1. Be Seen
"Notice my contributions—especially the invisible ones."

### 2. Be Heard
"Ask my perspective before judging my performance."

### 3. Be Respected
"Match recognition to my preferences, not yours."

### 4. Be Developed
"Invest in my growth, not just my output."

### 5. Be Supported
"When I struggle, assume context before assuming fault."

---

## Application: Questions to Ask Yourself

Before giving feedback, ask:

1. **Have I investigated the context?**
   - What might explain this?
   - What don't I know?

2. **Am I leading with curiosity or judgment?**
   - "What happened?" vs. "Why did you do this?"

3. **Am I seeing the full picture?**
   - What invisible work am I missing?
   - What circumstances affect performance?

4. **Am I matching approach to person?**
   - Do they prefer public or private recognition?
   - Are they struggling with something I don't know about?

5. **Is this a performance problem or a support need?**
   - Is this within their control?
   - What do they need to succeed?

---

## Your Commitment

Based on these perspectives, what will you do differently?

"I will..."
[Space for personal commitment]
```
