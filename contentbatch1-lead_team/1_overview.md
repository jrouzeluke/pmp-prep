Leadership Styles (Goleman)

⭐1. Authoritative/Visionary
When: New direction needed, team lacks clarity
Effect: Most positive impact on climate
Action: "Here's where we're going, you determine how"

🎓2. Coaching
When: Developing team members, time available
Effect: Builds long-term capabilities
Action: "Try this approach, let me give you feedback"

🤝3. Affiliative
When: Team stressed, relationships strained, after conflict
Effect: Builds harmony and trust
Action: "People first, let's support each other"

💬4. Democratic/Participative
When: Need buy-in, team has expertise, time available
Effect: Builds consensus and engagement
Action: "What do you think we should do?"

⚡5. Pacesetting
When: Quick results needed, competent team, short-term only
Effect: Can damage climate if overused
Action: "Do as I do, follow my example"

⚠️6. Commanding/Coercive
When: Crisis/emergency ONLY, immediate action required
Effect: Most negative long-term impact
Action: "Do what I say, now"

Quick Scenarios

Team is new and members don't know each other or their roles
Wrong: Let them self-organize immediately (Delegating too early)
Right: Provide clear structure, facilitate introductions, establish ground rules (Forming stage needs direction)
New teams need PM guidance and structure

Two senior developers publicly arguing about technical approach in team meeting
Wrong: Force a decision to end argument quickly (Commanding)
Right: Acknowledge both views, facilitate problem-solving discussion (Storming stage needs coaching)
Conflict in Storming is normal and needs facilitation, not suppression

High-performing team consistently delivering excellent results
Wrong: Continue making all decisions to maintain control (Commanding)
Right: Delegate authority, remove obstacles, focus on strategic issues (Performing stage needs autonomy)
High performers need trust and empowerment, not micromanagement

Team just completed intense 3-month death march and morale is low
Wrong: Immediately start next high-pressure project (Pacesetting)
Right: Acknowledge effort, provide recovery time, rebuild relationships (Affiliative)
Burned-out teams need care and relationship repair

Major organizational change affecting team, high anxiety
Wrong: Focus only on deliverables and ignore emotions (Pacesetting)
Right: Provide vision, address concerns, offer support (Authoritative + Affiliative)
Change requires clear direction combined with emotional support
