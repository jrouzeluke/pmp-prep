## How This Module Supports Your PMP Application

When documenting your project experience for the PMP application, you'll need to describe situations where you demonstrated these competencies. This module provides:

1. **Common language and frameworks** - Use PMI terminology when describing your experience
2. **Specific examples** - Real-world scenarios that illustrate these concepts
3. **Best practices** - Evidence-based approaches you can implement and document
4. **Reflection prompts** - Questions to help you identify relevant experiences from your project work

## Application Tips

When writing your PMP application experience descriptions:

- **Be specific**: "Led team through forming stage by facilitating kickoff meeting and establishing team charter" is better than "Led team meetings"
- **Use action verbs**: Facilitated, coached, resolved, empowered, developed, inspired
- **Include outcomes**: Connect your leadership actions to project results
- **Reference frameworks**: Mention Tuckman's model, leadership styles, or conflict resolution approaches when relevant
- **Demonstrate range**: Show you've used different leadership approaches in different situations
