# Deep Dive: Leadership Styles in Project Management

## Introduction

Effective project managers don't rely on a single leadership approach. Instead, they adapt their style based on the situation, team maturity, and individual team member needs. This deep dive explores six primary leadership styles, drawn from Daniel Goleman's research on emotional intelligence and leadership.

Understanding when and how to use each style is essential for maximizing team performance and navigating the diverse challenges project managers face.

## The Six Leadership Styles

### 1. Commanding (Coercive, Directive)

**Description:** "Do what I tell you."

The leader makes decisions unilaterally and expects immediate compliance. Clear direction with little input from team members.

#### When to Use

✓ **Crisis situations** - When quick, decisive action is needed
✓ **Forming stage** - New teams need clear structure and direction
✓ **Dealing with problem employees** - When other approaches have failed
✓ **High-risk situations** - Safety issues or critical deadlines
✓ **Turnaround situations** - When a project is failing and needs immediate correction

#### Strengths

- Provides clear direction and structure
- Enables quick decision-making
- Effective in emergencies
- Establishes authority and control
- Works well with inexperienced team members

#### Weaknesses

- Can damage morale and motivation
- Stifles creativity and innovation
- Reduces team member development
- Creates dependency on leader
- May cause resentment and resistance
- Limits information flow from team

#### Impact on Team Performance

**Positive:** Can dramatically improve short-term performance in crisis
**Negative:** Most negative long-term impact on team climate and engagement

#### Best Practices

- Use sparingly and temporarily
- Explain the rationale when possible
- Transition to more collaborative styles as soon as feasible
- Balance with relationship-building activities
- Monitor team morale closely

#### Example Scenarios

**Appropriate:**
- "We have a security breach. Everyone stop what you're doing. Tom, lock down the servers. Maria, notify legal. I need status reports every 30 minutes."

**Inappropriate:**
- Using this style as default during normal operations
- Micromanaging experienced team members
- Refusing to listen to team input on routine decisions

### 2. Authoritative (Visionary)

**Description:** "Come with me."

The leader provides a clear vision and direction but allows team members autonomy in how they achieve goals. Inspires and mobilizes toward a shared vision.

#### When to Use

**Inappropriate:**
- With a team of world-class experts who know the domain better than you
- When the situation requires detailed task direction
- If you haven't established credibility yet

## Situational Leadership: Choosing the Right Style

### The Situational Leadership Model

Effective leaders diagnose the situation and adapt their style accordingly. Consider these factors:

#### 1. Team Development Stage (Tuckman's Model)

| Stage | Recommended Primary Style | Supporting Style |
|-------|--------------------------|------------------|
| Forming | Commanding → Authoritative | Affiliative |
| Storming | Coaching | Affiliative |
| Norming | Democratic | Authoritative |
| Performing | Delegating/Democratic | Coaching |
| Adjourning | Coaching | Affiliative |

#### 2. Task Maturity (Hersey-Blanchard Model)

Consider competence and commitment of team members:

- **Low Competence, High Commitment** (Enthusiastic Beginner)
  - Use: Commanding/Authoritative with Coaching
  - Provide clear direction and frequent feedback

- **Some Competence, Low Commitment** (Disillusioned Learner)
  - Use: Coaching with Affiliative
  - Support confidence building and skill development

- **High Competence, Variable Commitment** (Capable but Cautious)
  - Use: Participative/Democratic
  - Involve in decisions, rebuild confidence

- **High Competence, High Commitment** (Self-Reliant Achiever)
  - Use: Delegating
  - Empower and trust, remove obstacles

#### 3. Urgency and Risk

- **High Urgency/Risk:** Commanding → Authoritative → Pacesetting
- **Medium Urgency/Risk:** Authoritative → Democratic → Coaching
- **Low Urgency/Risk:** Democratic → Coaching → Affiliative

#### 4. Complexity

- **High Complexity:** Democratic (need diverse input) + Coaching
- **Medium Complexity:** Authoritative + Coaching
- **Low Complexity:** Delegating + Pacesetting

---

## Combining Leadership Styles

The most effective leaders use **multiple styles flexibly**, often within the same day or meeting.

### Effective Combinations

**Authoritative + Democratic**
- Set clear vision, then involve team in determining how to achieve it
- Example: "Our goal is to reduce defects by 50%. Let's collaborate on the best approach."

**Coaching + Pacesetting**
- Set high standards while developing capability to meet them
- Example: "Here's the quality level we need. Let me work with you to build those skills."

**Affiliative + Authoritative**
- Build relationships while providing clear direction
- Example: "I know this is stressful. We're in this together, and here's how we'll succeed."

**Democratic + Commanding**
- Seek input regularly, but be decisive when needed
- Example: "I value your input, but given the emergency, I'm making the call."

### Style Transitions

As teams develop, shift your primary style:

1. **Project Start:** Commanding/Authoritative → Democratic
2. **During Crisis:** Democratic → Commanding (temporarily)
3. **Return to Normal:** Commanding → Democratic/Coaching
4. **High Performance:** Democratic → Delegating
5. **Project Close:** Any style → Coaching/Affiliative

## Common Leadership Mistakes

### 1. One-Style-Fits-All Approach
**Problem:** Using the same style regardless of situation
**Solution:** Develop flexibility across multiple styles

### 2. Overusing Commanding Style
**Problem:** Creating dependent, unmotivated team
**Solution:** Use only when necessary, transition quickly to more collaborative styles

### 3. Avoiding Difficult Conversations (Over-Affiliative)
**Problem:** Performance issues accumulate
**Solution:** Balance relationship focus with accountability

### 4. Excessive Pacesetting
**Problem:** Team burnout and declining morale
**Solution:** Reserve for short bursts, balance with Coaching

### 5. Democratic Paralysis

**Problem:** Team confusion about expectations
**Solution:** Explain your leadership choices when appropriate
