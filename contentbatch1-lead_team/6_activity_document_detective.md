## Document 2: Week 3 Meeting Notes

```
Project Phoenix Team Meeting
Date: Week 3, Wednesday 10:00 AM
Attendees: Jordan, Alex, Morgan, Sam, Casey

AGENDA:
1. Status updates
2. Technical architecture discussion
3. AOB

NOTES:

Jordan: Let's go around for status updates. Alex, you start.

Alex: We've made good progress on the backend framework. However, I think we should reconsider the database choice. PostgreSQL would be better than MySQL for this use case.

Jordan: We already decided on MySQL. Let's stick with the plan.

Alex: But the requirements have evolved. PostgreSQL handles JSON better and—

Jordan: I appreciate the input, but we need to move forward. Morgan, your update?

Morgan: I've completed initial wireframes, but I'm not sure they align with what users actually need. Should we do some user research first?

Jordan: We don't have time for research. Use the requirements doc I provided.

Morgan: The requirements are pretty vague on user workflows—

Jordan: Just do your best with what you have. Sam?

Sam: I've been trying to connect with stakeholders for clarification, but nobody's responding to my emails. Can you help escalate?

Jordan: I'll handle stakeholder communication. You focus on documentation. Casey?

Casey: Nothing to report yet. Still waiting for something to test.

[Awkward silence]

Alex: Jordan, can we talk about the sprint planning process? It feels like—

Jordan: Let's table that for another time. We're already over on time. Meeting adjourned.

[Team members leave quickly, some visibly frustrated]

## Document 3: Private Email Thread (Week 4)

```
From: Morgan Taylor
To: Alex Chen
Date: Week 4, Thursday
Subject: This project...

Alex,

Is it just me, or is Jordan being really controlling? Every suggestion gets shot down. I don't feel like my UX expertise matters at all.

I'm just going to do what I'm told and collect my paycheck. Not worth the stress.

From: Alex Chen  
To: Morgan Taylor
Date: Week 4, Thursday
Subject: RE: This project...

Morgan,

You're not alone. I've been on projects with micromanagers before, but this is next level. 

Sam and I were talking at lunch—we're both frustrated. The requirements are a mess, stakeholders are confused, and we're not allowed to fix anything.

I'm thinking about requesting a transfer. This project is going to fail and I don't want it on my record.

- Alex

From: Morgan Taylor
To: Alex Chen  
Date: Week 4, Friday
Subject: RE: This project...

Just had a conversation with Casey. They're also looking for an exit. At this rate, we might not have a team left.

Should someone talk to Jordan's manager?

## Document 6: Alternative Universe - Week 3 Meeting (Better Approach)

```
Project Phoenix Team Meeting
Date: Week 3, Wednesday 10:00 AM  
Attendees: Jordan, Alex, Morgan, Sam, Casey

AGENDA (created collaboratively via Slack):
1. Status roundtable
2. Technical architecture discussion (Alex)
3. User research proposal (Morgan)
4. Stakeholder access challenges (Sam)

NOTES:

Jordan: Thanks everyone for contributing to the agenda. Let's start with a quick roundtable. Keep it to 2 minutes each—focus on wins, blockers, and help needed.

[Everyone shares briefly]

Jordan: Great updates. Alex, you flagged the database discussion. Walk us through your thinking.

Alex: [Presents PostgreSQL vs MySQL analysis]

Jordan: Strong points. What does everyone think? Morgan, from a UX perspective?

Morgan: PostgreSQL's JSON support could help with the dynamic forms we're planning.

Sam: Performance benchmarks favor PostgreSQL for our read patterns too.

Casey: Either works for testing, but PostgreSQL has better community support.

Jordan: Sounds like we have consensus. Alex, can you document the decision rationale and send it to stakeholders? I'll support the change recommendation.

Alex: Absolutely. I'll have it to you by EOD.

Jordan: Perfect. Morgan, tell us about your user research proposal.

Morgan: [Presents lightweight research plan]

Jordan: I love the approach. My concern is timeline. How can we get value quickly?

Morgan: If we focus on just 5 user interviews next week, we'd have enough to validate the core workflows.

Jordan: Who can support Morgan with interviews?

Sam: I can help with recruiting and note-taking.

Jordan: Excellent. Let's pilot this. If it's valuable, we continue. If not, we'll adjust. Morgan, you own the decision on how to proceed after the pilot.

Morgan: Thanks for the trust. I'll make it count.

Jordan: Sam, talk to us about stakeholder access.

Sam: [Explains challenges]

Jordan: That's on me to fix. I'll set up a standing stakeholder office hours next week. In the meantime, let me introduce you directly via email so you have direct access.

Sam: That would really help.

Jordan: Before we close, what's one thing I could do differently to better support each of you?

[Team provides feedback, Jordan takes notes]

Jordan: This is super helpful. I'll work on being less directive and creating more space for your expertise. Keep me honest on that.

Casey: Appreciate you asking!

Jordan: We're building something great together. Next meeting, Casey leads standup and Alex runs the technical discussion. Sound good?

[Team agreement]

Meeting adjourned: 10:42 AM
