| E | **Affiliative + Coaching** | Recognition and empowerment |
| F | **Delegating** | Trust and empowerment for capable team |
| G | **Commanding** | Appropriate for crisis |

## Discussion Questions

### Pattern Recognition

1. **How long did each stage last?**
   - Forming: 2-3 weeks
   - Storming: 5-6 weeks (nearly derailed project)
   - Norming: 3-4 weeks
   - Performing: 4+ months
   - Adjourning: 3-4 weeks

2. **What triggered transitions between stages?**
   - Forming→Storming: Natural evolution + poor conflict management

3. **How did PM's leadership style evolve?**
   - Started too directive
   - Learned to facilitate and delegate
   - Adapted to situations appropriately
   - Returned to directive only when needed (crisis, performance)

### Critical Thinking

   - Team would likely have dissolved
   - Multiple resignations probable
   - Project failure likely

5. **Why did the team accept directive leadership during crisis (Card G) but resent it earlier (Card B)?**
   - Trust had been built by Month 5
   - Crisis context was clear

6. **How did addressing Kevin's performance (Card J) affect team?**
   - Demonstrated accountability
   - Prevented resentment

   - Transitioning to delegating style
   - Consistent recognition and celebration
   - Appropriate style flexibility

8. **What could the PM have done differently in Month 1?**
   - More collaborative kickoff approach
   - Facilitate architecture discussion (Card B)
