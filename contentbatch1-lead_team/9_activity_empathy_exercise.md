## The Project Scenario

**Context:** You're a PM on a 6-month mobile app development project. The team consists of:

- **Sarah** - Senior developer, 15 years experience, technical expert
- **Marcus** - Mid-level developer, 4 years experience, ambitious
- **Priya** - Junior developer, first job out of college, eager learner
- **Jamal** - UX designer, 8 years experience, creative and passionate
- **Alex** - QA engineer, 6 years experience, detail-oriented perfectionist
- **YOU** - Project Manager, focused on delivering on time and budget

---

## Part 1: The Situation

### Week 5: The Scope Change

**What Happened:**

Your executive sponsor just informed you that a major feature needs to be added to the project. The deadline remains the same. You call an emergency team meeting to announce the change and reassign work.

**In the meeting, you say:**

*"Team, I know this isn't ideal timing, but we need to add the social sharing feature to our MVP. The CEO saw a competitor launch it and we need parity. I've already committed to the original deadline, so we'll need to work smarter. Sarah, you'll need to reprioritize and lead the new feature development. Marcus and Priya, you'll support Sarah. Jamal, I need revised designs by Friday. Alex, you'll need to compress testing timelines. Any questions?"*

**Team reactions in the meeting:**
- Sarah: Silent, jaw clenched
- Marcus: Nods enthusiastically
- Priya: Looks anxious, takes notes
- Jamal: Starts to speak, stops, looks frustrated
- Alex: Crosses arms, shakes head

## Part 2: Step Into Their Shoes

**Instructions:** Read each perspective deeply. Try to FEEL what this person is experiencing, not just understand it intellectually.

---

### Perspective 1: Sarah (Senior Developer)

**My Background:**
I've been in tech for 15 years. I've seen countless projects derailed by scope creep and unrealistic deadlines. I'm the most experienced person on this team technically, and I care deeply about building quality software.

**What I'm Thinking:**

*"Here we go again. Another executive whim that becomes our emergency. I wasn't consulted about whether this timeline is even feasible. The PM just 'already committed' without talking to the technical team? That's not leadership, that's politics.*

*I'm tired of being voluntold to work extra hours because someone made promises we can't keep. I have a family. I have a life outside work. But I know what 'work smarter' means—it means work longer.*

*And now I'm responsible for delivering this rushed feature. When quality suffers—and it will—it'll be my name on it. My reputation. The PM will report green status upstream while we're scrambling.*

*I should speak up. But what's the point? Decision's already made. I've learned that challenging leadership just gets you labeled as 'not a team player.'*

*I'm counting the days until I can find a project with a PM who actually respects their team's expertise."*

**What I'm Feeling:**
- Disrespected (not consulted)
- Trapped (can't refuse)
- Resentful (forced commitment)
- Angry (pattern repeating)
- Exhausted (anticipating extra hours)
- Undervalued (expertise ignored)

**What I Need:**
- To be consulted before commitments are made
- Honest conversation about trade-offs
- Respect for my time and expertise
- Realistic expectations
- Acknowledgment that this is hard

**What I Wish the PM Had Said:**

*"I just learned the CEO wants social sharing added. I know this is tough. Before I respond to the exec team, I need your expert input. Is this feasible by the deadline? If not, what would it take—more time, reduced scope elsewhere, or additional resources? Your technical judgment matters here. Let's figure this out together."*

---

### Perspective 2: Marcus (Mid-Level Developer)

**My Background:**
I've been working for 4 years and I'm ambitious. I want to become a senior developer and eventually a tech lead. I'm always looking for opportunities to prove myself and learn from experienced people like Sarah.

**What I'm Thinking:**

*"This is my chance. A high-visibility feature with exec attention. If I can help Sarah deliver this and do good work, it might lead to a promotion or at least recognition.*

*I'm excited to work closely with Sarah—she's brilliant and I can learn so much from her. This kind of stretch assignment is exactly what I need to develop my skills.*

*I don't mind the extra hours. I'm single, no kids, and I'm building my career. Some people complain about work-life balance, but I'm in my investment phase. I'll have work-life balance later.*

*I hope Sarah lets me take on substantial parts of this. Sometimes senior developers hoard the interesting work. I want to contribute meaningfully, not just write boilerplate code.*

*This is exciting! Bring it on."*

**What I'm Feeling:**
- Excited (opportunity to shine)
- Motivated (challenge accepted)
- Ambitious (career advancement)
- Eager (learn from Sarah)
- Competitive (prove capability)
- Anxious (hope to get good assignments)

**What I Need:**
- Meaningful work, not just support tasks
- Chance to demonstrate capabilities
- Learning opportunities from Sarah
- Recognition for contributions
- Clear success criteria

**What I Wish the PM Had Said:**

*"Marcus, I know you've been wanting more challenging assignments. This will be intense, but it's a chance to grow your skills working with Sarah. I want you to take a leading role in the implementation, not just support. Let's talk about what you want to learn from this experience."*

---

### Perspective 3: Priya (Junior Developer)

**My Background:**
This is my first real job. I graduated college 8 months ago. I'm still learning so much and trying to prove I belong here. I have imposter syndrome and worry constantly about making mistakes.

**What I'm Thinking:**

*"Oh no. Oh no. A high-pressure feature with a tight deadline and I'm supposed to 'support' Sarah? What does that even mean? What if I mess up and delay everyone?*

*I barely understand our current architecture, and now we're adding something major? I'll need to ask so many questions. But everyone's busy and stressed. Will they think I'm incompetent?*

*Maybe I should just figure it out on my own. But last time I did that, I went down the wrong path for two days. Sarah had to redo my work. I felt terrible.*

*I don't mind working extra hours—everyone else will be. But I work so much slower than Marcus and Sarah. What if I can't keep up? What if I'm the bottleneck?*

*Should I have asked a question in that meeting? But I didn't want to look like I didn't understand. Everyone else seemed to just accept the plan.*

*I'm scared."*

**What I'm Feeling:**
- Anxious (performance pressure)
- Inadequate (skill gap)
- Afraid (of making mistakes)
- Overwhelmed (complexity + speed)
- Isolated (afraid to ask for help)
- Imposter syndrome activated

**What I Need:**
- Clear expectations for my role
- Permission to ask questions
- Regular check-ins
- Reassurance that learning takes time
- Specific guidance on what to focus on
- Psychological safety to make mistakes

**What I Wish the PM Had Said:**

*"Priya, I know you're still learning our codebase. This will be challenging, but it's also a growth opportunity. You'll work closely with Sarah and Marcus, and I expect you to ask lots of questions—that's how we learn. We'll have daily 15-minute check-ins where you can get unblocked. Nobody expects you to work at Sarah's pace yet. You're here to learn and contribute what you can."*

### Perspective 4: Jamal (UX Designer)

**My Background:**
I've been a UX designer for 8 years. I'm passionate about creating experiences that users love. I believe good design takes time, research, and iteration. I've won awards for my work.

**What I'm Thinking:**

*"Designs by Friday? That's three days! The PM clearly doesn't understand the design process. I need to:
- Research how competitors implement this
- Understand user needs and workflows  
- Create multiple concepts
- Test with users
- Iterate based on feedback

*But there's no time for any of that. I'll be expected to create something fast and 'good enough.' That's not how I work. That's not how good UX happens.*

*And then, when users hate the feature because we didn't do proper discovery, guess whose fault it'll be? The designer's. Not the PM who set impossible deadlines.*

*I tried to speak up but stopped. What's the point? The deadline is already set. They think design is just 'making it pretty' at the end, not fundamental to the product.*

*I feel like a pixel-pusher, not a designer. This isn't what I signed up for. I miss working at agencies where design was valued.*

*Maybe I should just create something mediocre and collect my paycheck. Why should I care more about quality than anyone else does?"*

**What I'm Feeling:**
- Frustrated (process ignored)
- Disrespected (expertise devalued)
- Defeated (compromised quality)
- Cynical (why bother?)
- Resentful (blamed for outcomes)
- Professionally constrained

**What I Need:**
- Understanding of design process
- Realistic timelines or reduced scope
- Collaboration in defining what's possible
- Voice in trade-off decisions
- Recognition of professional expertise
- Support when pushing back on quality

**What I Wish the PM Had Said:**

*"Jamal, I know Friday is aggressive for designs. Walk me through what good design process would look like and how long it takes. Then let's figure out together what we can realistically deliver—maybe we scope down the feature, push the deadline, or find a middle path. Your expertise drives these trade-offs. What do you recommend?"*

---

### Perspective 5: Alex (QA Engineer)

**My Background:**
I've been in QA for 6 years. I take pride in finding bugs before customers do. I've seen what happens when quality is compromised—customer complaints, support costs, reputation damage. My job is to protect quality.

**What I'm Thinking:**

*"'Compress testing timelines.' That's code for 'skip testing and hope for the best.' This is how disasters happen.*

*I already have a full test backlog for the existing features. Now we're adding a major feature and I'm supposed to test it all faster? That's not how quality works. Testing is the last phase, so any delays upstream become my problem.*

*And when we ship with bugs—because there's no time to find them all—who gets blamed? QA. 'Why didn't you catch that?' Because you gave me two days to test a feature that needs two weeks!*

*Nobody respects QA until something breaks in production. Then suddenly it's critical. But when planning timelines, we're an afterthought. Testing is treated as a checkbox, not a process.*

*I should push back, but I'm outvoted. Everyone wants to move fast. I'm the one saying 'slow down, let's do it right.' That makes me the bad guy.*

*If I say it'll take two weeks, they'll say 'find a way to do it in three days.' If I compromise and something breaks, it's my fault. I can't win.*

*I'm tired of being the quality gatekeeper when nobody else cares about quality."*

**What I'm Feeling:**
- Defensive (anticipated blame)
- Powerless (timeline dictated)
- Anxious (about what will be missed)
- Unappreciated (role undervalued)
- Conflicted (quality vs. deadline)
- Professional integrity threatened

**What I Need:**
- Realistic test timeline or scope reduction
- Involvement in feasibility assessment
- Support when raising quality concerns
- Shared responsibility for quality (not just QA)
- Recognition of testing as skilled work
- Risk acknowledgment from leadership

**What I Wish the PM Had Said:**

*"Alex, this deadline is tight and I need your honest assessment. What level of test coverage can we achieve realistically? What risks are we taking? I'll support whatever you recommend, whether that's pushing the deadline, reducing scope, or accepting specific risks with executive awareness. Your job is quality, and mine is making sure you have what you need to do it."*
