I was ready to quit. Now he's one of my best work friends. That conflict resolution session you facilitated changed everything.\n\nThis team became something special. The way we handled Sam's onboarding, how we manage production issues without even needing you - I've never experienced a team like this.\n\nI'm sad it's ending.
