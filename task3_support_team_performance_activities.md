# ACTIVITY 1: PM SIMULATOR
## 7 Decision Scenarios

**Instructions:** You're the project manager facing real performance situations. Choose the best response for each scenario. After selecting, you'll see detailed analysis of all options.

---

### Scenario 1: The Declining Star

**Context:** Maya has been your top performer for 8 months. Over the past 3 weeks, her code quality has dropped significantly—40% of her commits need rework. She's also been quieter in standups and left early twice. You have a 1-on-1 scheduled tomorrow.

**What do you do?**

A) Start the 1-on-1 by sharing the performance data and asking her to explain the decline

B) Start the 1-on-1 by checking in on how she's doing, then share your observations and ask for her perspective

C) Skip the 1-on-1 and give her another week to see if things improve on their own

D) Email her the performance data before the 1-on-1 so she can prepare an explanation

**Best Answer: B**

**Analysis:**
| Option | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| A | Too aggressive. Leading with data feels like an interrogation. She'll get defensive. |
| **B** | ✅ Best. Opens with care, then uses SBI approach. Shows you see her as a person first. Creates psychological safety for honest conversation. |
| C | Avoidance. Three weeks is already a pattern. Waiting enables further decline. |
| D | Feels punitive. Written data without context reads as "you're in trouble." |

**Key Principle:** When a strong performer declines suddenly, investigate with empathy first. Something has changed—personal, professional, or environmental.

---

### Scenario 2: The Public Mistake

**Context:** During a client demo, your developer Raj presented a feature that crashed twice. The client looked frustrated. Raj is visibly embarrassed. The team is still in the room packing up.

**What do you do?**

A) Address it now while everyone remembers what happened: "Raj, let's talk about what went wrong with the demo"

B) Say nothing now. Pull Raj aside privately within the next hour to discuss

C) Send a team email after the meeting about the importance of testing before demos

D) Wait until the next sprint retrospective to discuss demo preparation as a team topic

**Best Answer: B**

**Analysis:**
| Option | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| A | Public criticism. Humiliates Raj in front of peers and reinforces his embarrassment. |
| **B** | ✅ Best. Timely (within the hour) but private. Respects dignity while addressing the issue promptly. |
| C | Passive-aggressive. Everyone knows it's about Raj. Avoids direct conversation. |
| D | Too delayed. The learning moment is lost. Also makes it public in retro. |

**Key Principle:** Constructive feedback is always private. Timeliness matters, but never at the expense of dignity.

---

### Scenario 3: The Unsung Hero

**Context:** Your team just shipped a major release on time. During the final week, Priya worked late three nights to fix a critical integration issue that would have delayed launch. The team celebrated at standup, but no one specifically mentioned Priya's contribution.

**What do you do?**

A) Send a team-wide Slack message highlighting Priya's specific contribution to the release

B) Thank Priya privately in your next 1-on-1, scheduled for next week

C) Assume Priya knows her work was valued since the release was successful

D) Check with Priya about her recognition preferences, then recognize accordingly

**Best Answer: D**

**Analysis:**
| Option | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| A | Good intent, but assumes Priya wants public recognition. Some people don't. |
| B | Too delayed (next week) and only private. May miss the window of impact. |
| C | Dangerous assumption. Silence often feels like indifference. |
| **D** | ✅ Best. Respects individual preferences while ensuring recognition happens. Quick check: "Hey Priya, I want to recognize your work on the integration fix. Are you comfortable with a team shout-out or would you prefer I thank you privately?" |

**Key Principle:** Recognition should be timely, specific, and personalized. When in doubt, ask about preferences.

---

### Scenario 4: The Repeated Issue

**Context:** This is the third sprint where Alex has over-committed and under-delivered. Each time, he commits to 8+ story points and completes 4-5. You've had two informal conversations about it. The pattern continues.

**What do you do?**

A) Stop assigning Alex to critical path items until he demonstrates better estimation

B) Have a more formal conversation with documented expectations and a specific improvement plan

C) Escalate to Alex's functional manager since your coaching hasn't worked

D) Reduce Alex's sprint commitment yourself during planning to set him up for success

**Best Answer: B**

**Analysis:**
| Option | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| A | Punitive without conversation. Doesn't help Alex improve, just limits damage. |
| **B** | ✅ Best. Escalates formality appropriately. Two informal chats didn't work—time for documented expectations, specific goals, and follow-up timeline. |
| C | Premature. You've had informal conversations, but not a formal improvement plan. Exhaust your coaching first. |
| D | Removes Alex's agency. Doesn't address the root cause (estimation skill or overconfidence). |

**Key Principle:** Coaching → Formal conversation with plan → Escalation. Don't skip steps, but don't stay stuck either.

---

### Scenario 5: The Motivation Mystery

**Context:** Sam used to volunteer for extra work and bring energy to team discussions. Over the past month, he's doing the minimum—completing assigned work but no more. Quality is fine, but engagement is gone. Nothing obvious has changed on the project.

**What do you do?**

A) Assign Sam to a high-visibility task to re-engage him

B) Have a 1-on-1 conversation to understand what's changed and what he needs

C) Document the change in engagement in case it becomes a performance issue

D) Give Sam space—everyone has ups and downs, and his work quality is still acceptable

**Best Answer: B**

**Analysis:**
| Option | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| A | Might backfire. If he's burned out or dealing with something, more pressure won't help. |
| **B** | ✅ Best. Investigate before assuming. Could be personal issues, boredom, feeling undervalued, career concerns, or team dynamics. You won't know until you ask. |
| C | Premature documentation. You haven't even talked to him yet. |
| D | Risky. "Acceptable" performance from a previously engaged person signals something wrong. Silence might feel like you don't care. |

**Key Principle:** Motivation issues require investigation, not assumptions. What changed? What does he need? Lead with curiosity.

---

### Scenario 6: The Growth Request

**Context:** Junior developer Kim asks to lead the next feature implementation. She's been solid on smaller tasks but hasn't led anything yet. The feature is medium complexity with a 3-week timeline. Your senior developers could do it faster.

**What do you do?**

A) Assign Kim to lead with a senior developer as backup, with clear check-in points

B) Tell Kim she needs more experience first and assign her to shadow the senior dev instead

C) Give Kim full ownership to see if she sinks or swims—that's how people learn

D) Split the difference: Kim leads the design, senior dev leads the implementation

**Best Answer: A**

**Analysis:**
| Option | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **A** | ✅ Best. Provides growth opportunity with appropriate guardrails. Check-ins allow course correction. Backup prevents project risk. |
| B | Misses development opportunity. Shadowing is fine, but she asked to lead. Consider her growth needs too. |
| C | Too risky. No support structure. If she struggles, you've set her up for failure and hurt the project. |
| D | Arbitrary split. Doesn't give her the full experience of leading. |

**Key Principle:** Development opportunities should stretch people while providing support. Growth happens at the edge of comfort, not off the cliff.

---

### Scenario 7: The Feedback Request

**Context:** After your 1-on-1, team member Jordan says: "I never know where I stand with you. Can you give me more feedback on how I'm doing?" Jordan's performance has been solid—not exceptional, not problematic.

**What do you do?**

A) Schedule monthly feedback sessions to give Jordan structured performance reviews

B) Commit to providing more real-time feedback—both positive and developmental—starting immediately

C) Share that Jordan is doing fine and not to worry—no news is good news

D) Ask Jordan what specific areas they want feedback on, then provide targeted input

**Best Answer: B (with elements of D)**

**Analysis:**
| Option | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| A | Too formal. Monthly reviews feel like performance management, not support. |
| **B** | ✅ Best. Addresses the real issue—Jordan doesn't feel seen. Commit to ongoing, real-time feedback. Solid performers need recognition too. |
| C | Dismissive. "No news is good news" is exactly the problem. Silence feels like indifference. |
| D | Good addition to B. Understanding what Jordan wants helps target your feedback. |

**Key Principle:** Solid performers often get neglected because they don't cause problems. But silence breeds disengagement. Proactive feedback retains your best people.

# ACTIVITY 3: DOCUMENT DETECTIVE
## 5 Artifacts to Analyze

**Instructions:** Review each document and identify the performance support issues, signals, or opportunities. What would you do as the PM?

---

## Document 1: Sprint Velocity Report

```
SPRINT VELOCITY - LAST 6 SPRINTS
Team: Platform Engineering (6 developers)

Sprint 18: 42 points committed / 38 completed (90%)
Sprint 19: 45 points committed / 41 completed (91%)
Sprint 20: 44 points committed / 40 completed (91%)
Sprint 21: 48 points committed / 32 completed (67%) ⚠️
Sprint 22: 40 points committed / 28 completed (70%) ⚠️
Sprint 23: 38 points committed / 31 completed (82%)

Individual Breakdown - Sprint 21-23:
┌─────────────┬─────────┬─────────┬─────────┐
│ Developer   │ Sp 21   │ Sp 22   │ Sp 23   │
├─────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┤
│ Sarah       │ 8/8     │ 8/8     │ 8/8     │
│ Mike        │ 8/8     │ 7/8     │ 8/8     │
│ Priya       │ 8/5 ⚠️  │ 6/4 ⚠️  │ 5/5     │
│ James       │ 8/8     │ 8/8     │ 8/8     │
│ Lin         │ 8/3 ⚠️  │ 6/3 ⚠️  │ 5/5     │
│ Alex        │ 8/0 ⚠️  │ 5/5     │ 4/5     │
└─────────────┴─────────┴─────────┴─────────┘
```

**What do you observe?**

**Analysis:**
- Team velocity dropped sharply in Sprints 21-22, partially recovering in 23
- Three developers (Priya, Lin, Alex) had significant drops in Sprint 21
- Alex had a complete miss (8/0) in Sprint 21—what happened?
- The team reduced commitments in Sprint 23, suggesting they learned
- Sarah, Mike, and James remained consistent throughout

**Questions to investigate:**
1. What happened in Sprint 21? (New technology? Key person out? Dependencies?)
2. Alex's 8/0 needs a conversation—was it an impediment or personal issue?
3. Are Priya and Lin struggling with something specific?
4. The recovery in Sprint 23 suggests the team adjusted—was this PM-driven or self-organizing?

**PM Action:** Don't call out individuals publicly. Have 1-on-1s with Priya, Lin, and Alex to understand root causes. Check if there were systemic issues in Sprint 21 affecting multiple people.

## Document 2: Slack Thread

```
#platform-team

[Monday 9:47 AM]
@dev-team Reminder: code freeze is Friday. All PRs must be reviewed and merged by Thursday EOD.

[Monday 2:15 PM]
Priya: Having trouble with the authentication module. Anyone worked with OAuth 2.0 refresh tokens before?

[Monday 2:16 PM]
Sarah: I have. Want to pair for 30 min?

[Monday 2:17 PM]
Priya: That would be amazing, thanks Sarah!

[Monday 4:45 PM]
Mike: @Lin your PR has been waiting for review for 2 days. I'm blocked on it.

[Monday 4:52 PM]
Lin: Sorry, been swamped. Will look tonight.

[Tuesday 9:15 AM]
Mike: @Lin still waiting...

[Tuesday 11:30 AM]
Lin: Reviewed. Left comments.

[Tuesday 11:35 AM]
Mike: These comments are about stuff we agreed on in design review. Why are you bringing it up now?

[Tuesday 11:40 AM]
Lin: Just doing my job. 🤷

[Tuesday 11:42 AM]
Mike: 🙄

[Wednesday 10:00 AM]
PM: Great teamwork everyone! Really appreciate the collaboration this week. 🎉
```

**What do you observe?**

**Analysis:**

**Positive signals:**
- Priya asked for help (psychological safety)
- Sarah immediately offered to pair (collaboration)
- The PM attempted recognition

**Problem signals:**
- Lin was unresponsive to Mike for 2 days, causing a blocker
- Lin's review raised previously-settled issues (passive-aggressive?)
- Tense exchange between Mike and Lin (🤷 and 🙄)
- PM's generic "great teamwork" message missed the actual tension

**PM Action:**
1. Have a private conversation with Lin about the delayed review and the design comments. Is Lin overloaded? Disagreeing with decisions? Checked out?
2. Separately, check in with Mike about the interaction
3. Don't let the tension fester—address it before it escalates
4. When recognizing, be specific. "Great teamwork" missed Sarah's actual help to Priya.

## Document 3: 1-on-1 Notes

```
1-on-1 Notes: Alex Chen
Date: November 15

ALEX'S ITEMS:
- None

PM ITEMS:
- Sprint 21 delivery (discussed)
- Career goals check-in

NOTES:
- Asked about Sprint 21 miss. Alex said "everything just piled up."
- Probed further. Alex mentioned "some personal stuff" but didn't want to discuss.
- Reminded Alex about EAP resources.
- Asked about career goals. Alex said "I don't know. I'm just trying to get through each day right now."
- Alex seemed tired. Less engaged than usual.
- Agreed to check in again next week.

ACTION ITEMS:
- Alex: Ping PM if he needs support
- PM: Follow up next week
```

**What do you observe?**

**Analysis:**

**Concerning signals:**
- Alex had no items to discuss (unusual for engaged employees)
- "Everything piled up" is vague—didn't get to root cause
- "Personal stuff" + "just trying to get through each day" + tired/less engaged = significant personal situation
- Alex may be experiencing burnout, personal crisis, or mental health challenges

**What the PM did well:**
- Mentioned EAP resources
- Didn't push too hard on personal details
- Scheduled follow-up

**What could be better:**
- The action item "Ping PM if he needs support" puts burden on Alex
- No concrete support offered (reduced workload, flexibility, etc.)

**PM Action:**
1. Proactively reduce Alex's workload next sprint—don't wait for him to ask
2. Follow up in a few days, not just "next week"
3. Make it easy for Alex to take what he needs (flexibility, time, support)
4. Watch for continued signs over coming weeks
5. If pattern continues, have a more direct conversation about what support would help

---

## Document 4: Recognition Email

```
From: PM
To: Team Distribution List
Cc: VP of Engineering
Subject: Great Q3 Results!

Team,

We crushed Q3! Our velocity was up 15% and we shipped 3 major features ahead of schedule. The executive team is really happy with our progress.

Keep up the great work!

Best,
[PM]
```

**What do you observe?**

**Analysis:**

**Issues with this recognition:**
- Generic and vague ("great work" with no specifics)
- No individuals recognized—who specifically contributed?
- CC'ing VP feels performative (PM showing off to leadership)
- "Executive team is happy" focuses on leadership, not the team's own achievement
- No mention of what made it successful (extra hours? Creative solutions? Collaboration?)
- Feels like a corporate announcement, not genuine appreciation

**Better recognition would:**
- Name specific contributions: "Sarah's refactor saved us 2 weeks"
- Acknowledge the effort: "I know the OAuth integration required late nights"
- Make it about the team, not executives' happiness
- Follow up with individual recognition tailored to preferences

**PM Action:** This email isn't harmful, but it's a missed opportunity. Follow up with specific, personal recognition for key contributors. Ask yourself: "If I were on this team, would this email make me feel seen?" Probably not.

---

## Document 5: Performance Review Comments

```
ANNUAL REVIEW: James Martinez
Role: Senior Developer
Rating: Meets Expectations

MANAGER COMMENTS:
James consistently delivers quality work on time. He's reliable and his code reviews are thorough. James is a solid contributor to the team.

No major issues to address.

GOALS FOR NEXT YEAR:
- Continue current performance
- Take on more complex assignments as available

JAMES'S COMMENTS:
[Left blank by employee]
```

**What do you observe?**

**Analysis:**

**Red flags:**
- "Meets Expectations" for a senior dev who's "consistently reliable" feels like a missed opportunity
- Generic feedback: "solid contributor," "no major issues"—what specifically is James great at?
- James left comments blank—disengaged? Doesn't see the point? Frustrated?
- Goals are passive ("as available") with no development plan
- No career conversation—where does James want to go?

**The risk:**
James is a solid performer being taken for granted. He's not causing problems, so he's not getting attention. This is how you lose good people—not with a bang, but with silence and indifference.

**PM Action:**
1. Have a real career conversation with James. Where does he want to be in 2 years?
2. Give James something to sink his teeth into—lead a feature, mentor a junior dev
3. Recognize James specifically and publicly (if he prefers)
4. Don't let "no problems" become "no attention"

# ACTIVITY 4: TIMELINE RECONSTRUCTOR
## "The Story of Jordan's Journey" — 15 Events

**Instructions:** These 15 events from Jordan's first year on your team are out of order. Arrange them chronologically and identify where PM interventions could have changed the outcome.

---

## Scrambled Events

**A.** Jordan submits resignation, citing "lack of growth opportunities"

**B.** Jordan joins the team with enthusiasm, asking lots of questions about architecture and processes

**C.** PM notices Jordan volunteering less in standups and planning sessions

**D.** Jordan completes first solo feature ahead of schedule with high-quality code

**E.** Jordan asks PM about opportunities to lead a feature; PM says "maybe next quarter"

**F.** In 1-on-1, Jordan mentions feeling "stuck" doing the same type of work

**G.** Jordan stops asking questions in architecture discussions

**H.** Annual review: Jordan receives "Meets Expectations" rating with generic feedback

**I.** Jordan declines invitation to join the platform modernization initiative

**J.** PM notices Jordan leaving exactly at 5 PM daily (previously stayed engaged longer)

**K.** Jordan asks teammate about open positions on other teams

**L.** Jordan receives no specific recognition for the ahead-of-schedule delivery

**M.** Jordan's manager mentions she seems "checked out" in a skip-level meeting

**N.** PM assigns Jordan to another similar task instead of the feature lead role

**O.** Jordan completes all assigned work adequately but with no extra effort

---

## Correct Chronological Order

| Order | Event | Phase |
|-------|-------|-------|
| 1 | **B** | Jordan joins the team with enthusiasm, asking lots of questions | 🟢 Engaged |
| 2 | **D** | Jordan completes first solo feature ahead of schedule | 🟢 Engaged |
| 3 | **L** | Jordan receives no specific recognition for the delivery | ⚠️ Missed opportunity |
| 4 | **E** | Jordan asks about leading a feature; PM says "maybe next quarter" | ⚠️ Missed opportunity |
| 5 | **N** | PM assigns Jordan to another similar task instead | ⚠️ Missed opportunity |
| 6 | **F** | In 1-on-1, Jordan mentions feeling "stuck" | 🟡 Warning sign |
| 7 | **C** | Jordan volunteers less in standups and planning | 🟡 Warning sign |
| 8 | **G** | Jordan stops asking questions in architecture discussions | 🟡 Disengaging |
| 9 | **J** | Jordan leaves exactly at 5 PM daily | 🟡 Disengaging |
| 10 | **O** | Jordan completes work adequately but with no extra effort | 🟡 Disengaging |
| 11 | **H** | Annual review: "Meets Expectations" with generic feedback | 🔴 Breaking point |
| 12 | **I** | Jordan declines the platform modernization invitation | 🔴 Checked out |
| 13 | **M** | Manager mentions Jordan seems "checked out" | 🔴 Checked out |
| 14 | **K** | Jordan asks teammate about positions on other teams | 🔴 Leaving |
| 15 | **A** | Jordan submits resignation | 🔴 Gone |

---

## Intervention Analysis

**Where could the PM have changed this trajectory?**

| Event | Missed Intervention |
|-------|---------------------|
| **L** (no recognition) | Specific recognition for ahead-of-schedule delivery would have reinforced behavior and shown Jordan was seen |
| **E** (maybe next quarter) | Could have said "Let's create a plan to get you there" instead of deferring |
| **N** (same type of work) | Should have given Jordan the stretch assignment she asked for |
| **F** (feeling stuck) | This was an explicit signal. PM should have acted immediately with a development plan |
| **C, G, J** (disengagement signs) | PM should have noticed the pattern and had a direct conversation |
| **H** (generic review) | The review was a chance to re-engage Jordan with recognition and growth plans |

**Key Lessons:**
1. Strong performers become disengaged performers through neglect
2. When someone asks for growth, take it seriously
3. Generic feedback feels like indifference
4. The signs were there—but they required paying attention
5. Once someone is looking at other teams, it's usually too late

# ACTIVITY 5: FEEDBACK TYPE MATCHER
## 12 Situations → Match to Approach

---

### Situation 1
A developer just presented a flawless demo to the client who was visibly impressed. The team meeting just ended.

**Best Match:**
- Purpose: **Positive**
- Timing: **Immediate**
- Delivery: **Public** (in team channel or next standup), **then private** for more detail

---

### Situation 2
A team member's code caused a production outage. This is the third incident this quarter. Previous informal conversations haven't changed behavior.

**Best Match:**
- Purpose: **Corrective**
- Timing: **Within 24 hours, scheduled meeting**
- Delivery: **Private** with **written follow-up** (documented improvement plan)

---

### Situation 3
A junior developer asks good questions but tends to go down rabbit holes, spending too much time on low-priority details.

**Best Match:**
- Purpose: **Coaching**
- Timing: **Scheduled 1-on-1**
- Delivery: **Private**

---

### Situation 4
A team member interrupted a colleague during their presentation, twice.

**Best Match:**
- Purpose: **Constructive**
- Timing: **Within 24 hours** (after the meeting, not during)
- Delivery: **Private**

---

### Situation 5
A developer stayed late three nights to fix a critical bug before release. No one else knows except you.

**Best Match:**
- Purpose: **Positive**
- Timing: **Within 24 hours**
- Delivery: **Ask preference** — some want public recognition, others prefer private thanks

---

### Situation 6
A team member missed a deadline for the second time, but quality was excellent when delivered. You haven't discussed this pattern yet.

**Best Match:**
- Purpose: **Coaching**
- Timing: **Scheduled 1-on-1**
- Delivery: **Private**

Note: This is coaching, not corrective, because you haven't addressed it before. Start with understanding, not formality.

---

### Situation 7
A senior developer mentored a junior teammate through a complex problem. You observed it in a pairing session.

**Best Match:**
- Purpose: **Positive**
- Timing: **Immediate or within 24 hours**
- Delivery: **Public** (if they're comfortable) — reinforces desired behavior for the whole team

---

### Situation 8
A team member sent a frustrated email to a stakeholder that was borderline unprofessional. The stakeholder forwarded it to you.

**Best Match:**
- Purpose: **Constructive**
- Timing: **Within 24 hours**
- Delivery: **Private** — understand context first before judging

---

### Situation 9
Performance has improved significantly since your last coaching conversation. The team member is now meeting expectations.

**Best Match:**
- Purpose: **Positive**
- Timing: **Next 1-on-1**
- Delivery: **Private** (specifically acknowledge the improvement)

---

### Situation 10
A new team member is struggling with the codebase after 3 weeks, making basic mistakes that others don't make.

**Best Match:**
- Purpose: **Coaching**
- Timing: **Scheduled 1-on-1**
- Delivery: **Private**

Note: Investigate first. Is it ability (training needed), opportunity (no good documentation), or something else?

---

### Situation 11
You overhear a team member complaining about another teammate's work to a third person.

**Best Match:**
- Purpose: **Constructive**
- Timing: **Within 24 hours**
- Delivery: **Private**

Address the behavior (talking about peers behind their back) and redirect to direct conversation or raising concerns with you.

---

### Situation 12
A team member has been on a documented performance improvement plan for 4 weeks with no progress despite support.

**Best Match:**
- Purpose: **Corrective** (escalation)
- Timing: **Formal scheduled meeting**
- Delivery: **Private** with **written documentation**, likely involving functional manager

---

## Quick Decision Framework

When choosing feedback approach, ask:

```
1. What's the PURPOSE?
   → Reinforce? → Positive
   → Develop? → Coaching
   → Redirect? → Constructive
   → Formal issue? → Corrective

2. What's the TIMING?
   → Public positive? → Immediate or same day
   → Private positive? → Within 24-48 hours
   → Constructive/Coaching? → Within 24 hours, private
   → Corrective? → Scheduled formal meeting

3. What's the DELIVERY?
   → Positive + person comfortable? → Public option
   → Any issue? → ALWAYS private first
   → Formal? → Written documentation
```

# ACTIVITY 6: TEAM MEMBER PERSPECTIVES
## 5 Scenarios from the Receiving End

**Instructions:** Experience the same feedback delivered two different ways. Reflect on how each feels and what it makes you want to do.

---

## Scenario 1: The Missed Deadline

**Context:** You're a developer. You missed a deadline by one day because you discovered a security vulnerability that needed fixing. You didn't escalate it—just fixed it. Your PM asks to talk.

---

### Experience Version A

Your PM says:
> "You missed the deadline. I had to explain to the stakeholders why we were late. This makes the whole team look bad. I need you to hit your deadlines—no excuses. If there's a problem, you need to tell me immediately, not just decide on your own what to do."

**How does this feel?**
- Defensive? Frustrated? Unappreciated?

**What do you want to do next?**
- Explain yourself? Give up? Just say "okay" and disengage?

---

### Experience Version B

Your PM says:
> "I saw you delivered a day late, and I noticed you fixed a security issue that wasn't in scope. Can you walk me through what happened? I want to understand the situation."

*You explain the vulnerability.*

> "Okay, I appreciate you catching that—it could have been a bigger problem later. In the future, when you find something like this, can you flag it to me right away? That way we can decide together whether to absorb the delay or adjust scope. I'll handle the stakeholder communication. Thanks for the quality focus."

**How does this feel?**
- Heard? Respected? Motivated to communicate earlier next time?

**What do you want to do next?**
- Flag issues earlier? Trust your PM more? Stay engaged?

---

### Reflection
Version A assumes bad intent. Version B assumes good intent and seeks to understand. Both address the real issue (escalation), but B does it without damage.

---

## Scenario 2: The Public Praise

**Context:** You're an introverted developer. In front of the whole team at standup, your PM says:

---

### Experience Version A

> "Everyone, I want to give a huge shout-out to [Your Name]! They absolutely crushed it on the authentication module. Best work I've seen in months! Can we get a round of applause?"

*Everyone claps. You feel your face getting red.*

**How does this feel?**
- Uncomfortable? Exposed? Wishing you could disappear?

---

### Experience Version B

*PM sends you a private message after standup:*

> "Hey, I wanted you to know the authentication module was excellent work. The way you handled the edge cases saved us from three potential bugs. Really appreciate the attention to detail. Is there anything you'd like me to highlight to the broader team, or would you prefer to keep this between us?"

**How does this feel?**
- Seen? Valued? Respected for who you are?

---

### Reflection
Recognition that ignores preferences can feel like punishment. Version B recognizes AND respects how you prefer to receive it.

---

## Scenario 3: The Performance Gap

**Context:** You've been struggling with a new technology stack. You know your output has been slow. No one has said anything for 3 weeks.

---

### Experience Version A

*Your PM schedules a meeting called "Performance Discussion." In the meeting:*

> "I've been tracking your velocity, and you're significantly behind the team average. You've had 3 weeks to ramp up and it's not happening. I need to see immediate improvement or we'll need to have a more formal conversation. I'm documenting this meeting."

**How does this feel?**
- Ambushed? Set up to fail? Anxious?

---

### Experience Version B

*In your regular 1-on-1:*

> "I wanted to check in on how you're feeling with the new stack. I've noticed the work is taking longer than expected—how's the ramp-up going from your perspective?"

*You share that you've been struggling but didn't want to admit it.*

> "Thanks for being honest. That's really helpful. Let's figure out some support—would pairing with Marcus help? He's worked with this stack for a year. I can also find some focused documentation. What would make the biggest difference?"

**How does this feel?**
- Supported? Safe to be honest? Motivated to improve?

---

### Reflection
Three weeks of silence followed by formal warning = ambush. Regular check-ins with genuine support = development.

---

## Scenario 4: The Constructive Feedback

**Context:** You interrupted a colleague twice during their presentation. You didn't realize it. After the meeting, your PM approaches.

---

### Experience Version A

> "You interrupted Sarah twice during her presentation. That's really disrespectful. You need to be more aware of how you come across. People are noticing."

**How does this feel?**
- Attacked? Labeled? Like your character is being judged?

---

### Experience Version B

> "Hey, can I share something I observed? During Sarah's presentation, you jumped in with comments twice while she was mid-sentence. I don't think you realized it, but she lost her train of thought both times. I know you're engaged and have great ideas—can you hold them until she's finished and then build on what she said?"

**How does this feel?**
- Informed? Given a path to do better? Respected?

---

### Reflection
"You're disrespectful" is a character judgment. "You interrupted twice, here's the impact" is behavioral and actionable.

---

## Scenario 5: The Silent Treatment

**Context:** You've been doing solid, consistent work for 6 months. You haven't received any feedback—positive or constructive. Radio silence.

---

### Experience Version A

*Six months pass. Nothing. Then your annual review:*

> "You meet expectations. Keep doing what you're doing."

**How does this feel?**
- Invisible? Wondering if anyone notices? Like it doesn't matter if you stay or go?

---

### Experience Version B

*Over six months, you receive:*
- A specific thank-you for catching a bug before release
- A 1-on-1 where your PM asks about your career goals
- An invitation to lead a small initiative
- Recognition in a team meeting for helping a junior developer
- A note when your suggestion improved the process

**How does this feel?**
- Seen? Valued? Like your contributions matter? Like you want to stay?

---

### Reflection
Solid performers are often neglected because they don't cause problems. But silence breeds disengagement. The small moments of recognition and development attention are what retain good people.

---

## Summary: What Team Members Need

| What They Need | What Damages It |
|----------------|-----------------|
| To be seen | Silence, generic feedback, being ignored |
| To be heard | Jumping to conclusions, not asking perspective |
| To feel respected | Public criticism, character judgments |
| To grow | Same work, no development, "maybe next quarter" |
| To understand expectations | Ambush performance discussions |
| Recognition that fits them | One-size-fits-all public praise |
