# PMP Exam Bank 1: People - Managing Conflict
# ECO Alignment: Domain I, Task 1

## Question 1
Two senior developers on an agile team are in a heated debate over the technical architecture of a new feature. The disagreement is beginning to affect the sprint velocity. What should the project manager do first?
- [x] Facilitate a meeting between the two developers to help them reach a consensus.
- [ ] Make a final decision on the architecture to ensure the sprint stays on track.
- [ ] Escalate the issue to the functional manager to decide on the best technical approach.
- [ ] Separate the developers by assigning them to different tasks for the remainder of the sprint.
**Explanation:** In agile, the PM (or Scrum Master) should facilitate communication and empower the team to resolve technical conflicts internally before intervening authoritatively.

## Question 2
A project manager is overseeing a global project. Two stakeholders from different regions have conflicting requirements for a key deliverable. The project manager realizes this is due to a cultural misunderstanding. What is the best approach?
- [x] Identify the source of the conflict and facilitate a discussion to find a win-win solution.
- [ ] Request that the project sponsor decide which regional requirement takes precedence.
- [ ] Adhere strictly to the initial project charter and reject any requirements that deviate.

- [x] Analyze project priorities and discuss needs with managers to find an optimal schedule.
- [ ] Escalate to the PMO immediately.
- [ ] Tell the resource to decide which project they prefer.
**Explanation:** Using data and priorities to facilitate a resolution is the most professional and effective approach.

## Question 9
Which is a positive outcome of conflict if managed correctly?
- [ ] Increased groupthink
- [x] Improved creativity and better decision making
- [ ] A clearer hierarchy of power
- [ ] Reduced project documentation
**Explanation:** Constructive conflict allows different perspectives to be aired, leading to more innovative solutions.

## Question 10
A PM asks two parties to each give up something to reach a temporary solution. Which technique is this?
- [ ] Collaborating
- [x] Compromising
- [ ] Forcing
- [ ] Avoiding
**Explanation:** Compromising involves finding a middle ground where both parties concede certain points.

## Question 11
A team is in the "Storming" phase of development. Conflicts over roles and responsibilities are frequent. What should the PM do?
- [ ] Reassign the team members to different projects.
- [x] Guidance the team in establishing clear ground rules and role definitions.
- [ ] Allow the team to fail so they learn from the experience.
- [ ] Step back and let the team self-organize without any intervention.
**Explanation:** During Storming, the PM should provide high levels of guidance to help the team establish norms.

## Question 12
A stakeholder is unhappy with the project's progress and expresses this aggressively in a meeting. The PM acknowledges the stakeholder's concerns but refocuses the group on the items they currently agree on. This is:
- [ ] Forcing
- [ ] Compromising
- [x] Smoothing
- [ ] Collaborating
**Explanation:** Smoothing downplays the differences and emphasizes areas of agreement.

## Question 13
Two team members are arguing over which software tool to use. The PM directs them to use Tool A because it is the company standard, despite Tool B having better features for this specific task. This is:
- [ ] Problem Solving
- [x] Forcing
- [ ] Withdrawal
- [ ] Compromise
**Explanation:** Using authority or a mandate to resolve a conflict is Forcing.

## Question 14
Which conflict resolution technique is most likely to result in a permanent solution?
- [ ] Smoothing
- [ ] Compromising
- [ ] Forcing
- [x] Collaborating
**Explanation:** Collaboration addresses the root cause through consensus, making the solution more sustainable.

## Question 15
Conflict is most often caused by which of the following in a project environment?
- [ ] Personalities
- [ ] Cost
- [x] Schedules
- [ ] Management styles
**Explanation:** Statistically, schedule priorities are the most common source of conflict in projects.

## Question 16
An agile team is experiencing internal friction regarding who should perform testing. The PM suggests they try a "pair testing" approach for one sprint to see if it helps. This is:
- [x] Collaborative problem solving
- [ ] Forcing
- [ ] Avoiding
- [ ] Smoothing
**Explanation:** Experimenting with a solution based on team input is a collaborative way to solve a process problem.

## Question 17
A project manager is mediating a conflict. They ask each person to describe the other person's perspective. This is a technique to build:
- [ ] Authority
- [x] Empathy and understanding
- [ ] A paper trail
- [ ] A reason to terminate a member
**Explanation:** Active listening and perspective-sharing are key to resolving interpersonal conflicts.

## Question 18
When is "Avoiding" an appropriate conflict management strategy?
- [x] When the issue is trivial or more important issues are pressing.
- [ ] When you need a permanent solution.
- [ ] When you have more power than the other party.
- [ ] When the project is behind schedule.
**Explanation:** Avoiding is acceptable for low-impact issues where the effort to resolve exceeds the benefit.

## Question 19
A PM is working in a matrix organization. A functional manager pulls a resource off the project without notice. What is the PM's first step?
- [ ] Replace the resource with a contractor.
- [ ] Complain to the sponsor.
- [x] Meet with the functional manager to understand the reason and discuss project impact.
- [ ] Update the risk register and do nothing else.
**Explanation:** Direct communication to resolve the conflict and understand the constraint is the first step.

## Question 20
A team's ground rules were established but are now being ignored. This has led to several small conflicts. What should the PM do?
- [ ] Discipline the team members.
- [ ] Write new ground rules and distribute them.
- [x] Facilitate a team meeting to review and recommit to the ground rules.
- [ ] Ignore it as it is a natural part of team evolution.
**Explanation:** Ground rules are a team contract; the team must be involved in reviewing and enforcing them.

## Question 21
In a hybrid project, the agile development team and the predictive marketing team are at odds over delivery dates. The PM facilitates a session to align the two schedules. What is this?
- [ ] Forcing
- [ ] Withdrawal
- [x] Problem Solving
- [ ] Smoothing
**Explanation:** Aligning different perspectives to meet project goals is problem solving/collaboration.

## Question 22
A project manager uses their position of power to end an argument about a technical detail. What is the likely result?
- [ ] A win-win outcome.
- [x] A win-lose outcome and potential resentment.
- [ ] A long-term technical solution.
- [ ] Increased team cohesion.
**Explanation:** Forcing creates a winner and a loser, which often damages morale.

## Question 23
A customer wants a change that the lead engineer says is impossible. The PM brings them together to look at the data and requirements. What are they doing?
- [x] Collaborating to find a solution.
- [ ] Compromising on the scope.
- [ ] Avoiding a difficult conversation.
- [ ] Smoothing over the customer's anger.
**Explanation:** Bringing parties together to look at facts and find a way forward is collaboration.

- [x] Helping the team identify the pros and cons of different options.
- [ ] Assigning blame when a deadline is missed.
- [ ] Making all technical decisions.
**Explanation:** Facilitation involves guiding the process of decision-making without dictating the outcome.

## Question 25
Conflict management is part of which process group?
- [ ] Planning
- [x] Executing
- [ ] Closing
- [ ] Initiating
**Explanation:** Managing conflict occurs during the "Manage Team" process in the Executing phase.

## Question 26
A team member is upset because they feel their contributions are not recognized. The PM listens and validates their feelings. This is an application of:
- [ ] Technical skills
- [x] Emotional Intelligence
- [ ] Administrative skills
- [ ] Forcing
**Explanation:** Recognizing and responding to the emotions of others is a core part of Emotional Intelligence in conflict.

## Question 27
Two team members have a personality clash that is disrupting the office. The PM moves one to a different floor. This is:
- [ ] Problem Solving
- [x] Withdrawal/Avoidance
- [ ] Compromise
- [ ] Collaboration
**Explanation:** Physically separating people to avoid the conflict is a form of withdrawal/avoidance.

## Question 28
Which conflict resolution technique is most likely to be used when a project manager has little time and needs the team to just move forward?
- [ ] Collaboration
- [x] Forcing
- [ ] Problem Solving
- [ ] Negotiating
**Explanation:** Forcing is often used in emergencies when a quick decision is required.

## Question 29
A PM encourages the team to handle their own conflicts but steps in when the conflict becomes personal or destructive. This PM is practicing:
- [ ] Laissez-faire leadership
- [x] Servant leadership
- [ ] Dictatorial leadership

- [ ] Smoothing
- [ ] Avoiding
- [ ] Forcing
- [x] Problem Solving/Collaboration (using a shared fact base)
**Explanation:** Using the contract or SLA as a "single source of truth" helps resolve the conflict based on objective criteria.# PMP Exam Bank 1: People - Managing Conflict (Continued)
# ECO Alignment: Domain I, Task 1
# Questions 31-50

## Question 31
A project manager notices that two team members who previously collaborated well are now communicating only through email and avoiding eye contact in meetings. When asked individually, both say "everything is fine." What should the project manager do FIRST?
- [ ] Accept their answers and continue monitoring the situation.
- [ ] Reassign tasks so they no longer need to work together.
- [x] Share specific behavioral observations and express concern about the change in their working relationship.
- [ ] Escalate to HR since they are not being truthful.
**Explanation:** Sharing specific observations (not accusations) creates psychological safety for honest dialogue. Vague questions are easy to dismiss; observable behavior changes are harder to deny.

## Question 32
During a sprint retrospective, a team member becomes visibly upset and says, "Nobody listens to my ideas. I've suggested this fix three times and you all ignore me." What should the Scrum Master do?
- [ ] Move on to the next topic to avoid embarrassment.
- [ ] Ask the team to vote on whether the suggestion is valid.
- [x] Acknowledge the frustration, validate that being unheard is difficult, and facilitate a focused discussion on the suggestion.
- [ ] Schedule a private meeting to discuss the outburst.
**Explanation:** Emotional Intelligence requires acknowledging emotions when they arise. Validating feelings de-escalates tension and creates space for productive dialogue. Avoiding or dismissing emotions escalates conflict.

## Question 33
A senior stakeholder sends an aggressive email to the project manager, copying several executives, blaming the team for a delivery delay that was actually caused by late requirements from the stakeholder's own department. What is the BEST response?
- [ ] Reply-all with documentation proving the stakeholder caused the delay.
- [ ] Forward the email to your sponsor and ask them to handle it.
- [x] Respond privately to the stakeholder, acknowledge their frustration, and request a call to discuss the timeline together.
- [ ] Ignore the email until the next scheduled status meeting.
**Explanation:** Taking the conversation private de-escalates public conflict. Acknowledging frustration (even if misplaced) opens dialogue. Reply-all defensiveness escalates the situation and damages relationships.

## Question 34
Two functional managers are in conflict over a shared resource. The project manager has analyzed the situation and determined that Manager A's need is genuinely more critical to the project's critical path. What conflict resolution approach is MOST appropriate?
- [ ] Compromise by splitting the resource's time equally.
- [ ] Avoid the conflict by asking the resource to decide.
- [x] Collaborate by presenting the analysis to both managers and facilitating agreement on priorities.
- [ ] Force the decision by assigning the resource to Manager A.
**Explanation:** Even when the PM knows the "right" answer, collaboration builds buy-in and preserves relationships. Presenting objective data and facilitating discussion leads to sustainable solutions.

## Question 35
A project manager is facilitating a conflict resolution meeting between two team members. One team member dominates the conversation and repeatedly interrupts the other. What should the PM do?
- [ ] Let the conversation flow naturally to avoid appearing biased.
- [x] Establish ground rules for equal speaking time and actively ensure both voices are heard.
- [ ] End the meeting and speak with the dominant person privately.
- [ ] Side with the quieter person to balance the power dynamic.
**Explanation:** The PM as facilitator must create conditions for productive dialogue. This includes managing power imbalances and ensuring all perspectives are heard without taking sides.

## Question 36
An agile team has been self-organizing effectively for six months. A senior executive attends a sprint review and is unhappy with a decision the team made. The executive tells the project manager to "take control and start assigning work directly." What should the PM do?
- [ ] Follow the executive's direction to maintain the relationship.
- [ ] Ignore the executive since the team is self-organizing.
- [x] Acknowledge the executive's concern, share data on team performance, and explore the specific issue driving the feedback.
- [ ] Escalate to the project sponsor to resolve the disagreement.
**Explanation:** Protecting team empowerment requires addressing stakeholder concerns with evidence, not defensiveness. Understanding the root concern often reveals a solvable problem without abandoning self-organization.

## Question 37
A conflict between the development team and the QA team has been "resolved" three times in the past two months, but the same arguments keep recurring. What does this pattern indicate?
- [ ] The teams are incompatible and should be separated.
- [ ] The conflict resolution techniques being used are ineffective.
- [x] The root cause of the conflict has not been addressed.
- [ ] Conflict is normal and should be expected to recur.
**Explanation:** Recurring conflict is a symptom of unresolved root causes. Surface-level resolutions address symptoms but not underlying issues like unclear processes, competing goals, or systemic problems.

## Question 38
A project manager must choose between two conflict resolution approaches: collaborating (which will take 3 days) or compromising (which can be done in 2 hours). The project has a critical deadline in one week, and the conflict is blocking a critical path activity. What should the PM consider MOST?
- [ ] Always choose collaboration because PMI prefers it.
- [ ] Always choose the faster option when there's time pressure.
- [x] The importance of the issue and whether a partial solution will hold long-term.
- [ ] Which approach the team members prefer.
**Explanation:** Time pressure makes compromise acceptable, but only if the issue can tolerate a partial solution. Critical technical decisions may require collaboration despite time pressure; process disagreements may be fine to compromise on.

## Question 39
A team member approaches the project manager privately and says, "I think Alex is sabotaging my work, but I can't prove it." What should the PM do FIRST?
- [ ] Confront Alex about the accusation.
- [ ] Dismiss the concern since there's no proof.
- [x] Ask clarifying questions to understand specific behaviors that led to this perception.
- [ ] Document the complaint in case it escalates.
**Explanation:** Before acting, the PM needs to understand what's actually happening. "Sabotage" is an interpretation; specific behaviors are facts. Understanding the specifics enables appropriate response.

## Question 40
During project execution, the project manager discovers that a conflict between two departments was "resolved" by their respective VPs, but the resolution ignored project requirements and will cause significant rework. What should the PM do?
- [ ] Accept the resolution since VPs outrank the PM.
- [ ] Escalate to the project sponsor immediately.
- [x] Request a meeting with the VPs to present the project impact and explore alternatives.
- [ ] Document the issue and proceed with the rework.
**Explanation:** The PM is accountable for project outcomes and must advocate for the project, even with senior stakeholders. Presenting impact data professionally is appropriate; silent acceptance is not.

## Question 41
Which of the following is the BEST indicator that a conflict has been truly resolved rather than just suppressed?
- [ ] Both parties say they are satisfied.
- [ ] The PM has documented the resolution.
- [x] The parties are collaborating effectively and the triggering behavior has changed.
- [ ] Neither party has complained recently.
**Explanation:** True resolution shows in changed behavior and improved collaboration, not just verbal agreement. Suppressed conflict often looks resolved temporarily but re-emerges.

## Question 42
A project manager is working with a globally distributed team. A conflict arises because team members in one region feel their colleagues in another region are dismissive during video calls. Upon investigation, the PM realizes the issue is related to different cultural communication norms. What is the BEST approach?
- [ ] Establish a rule that everyone must follow the communication style of the project manager's region.
- [x] Facilitate a discussion about cultural differences and help the team develop shared communication norms.
- [ ] Separate the teams so they only communicate asynchronously.
- [ ] Ask the less assertive culture to adapt to the more assertive one.
**Explanation:** Cultural conflicts require awareness and shared norm-building, not imposing one culture's style. Collaborative development of team norms respects all parties and creates sustainable solutions.

## Question 43
A project manager overhears a team member making dismissive comments about a colleague's technical abilities to other team members. The colleague is not present. What should the PM do?
- [ ] Ignore it since the colleague didn't hear it.
- [ ] Publicly correct the team member immediately.
- [x] Address the behavior privately with the team member, explaining the impact on team trust.
- [ ] Report the incident to HR.
**Explanation:** Gossip and dismissive comments damage team trust even when the target isn't present. Private correction addresses the behavior without public humiliation. The PM must address it rather than ignore it.

## Question 44
A project has multiple vendors who frequently blame each other when deliverables are late. The PM has tried facilitating discussions, but the pattern continues. What should the PM do NEXT?
- [ ] Escalate to procurement to penalize the vendors.
- [ ] Accept that vendor conflicts are normal.
- [x] Implement clearer interface agreements and objective acceptance criteria to reduce ambiguity.
- [ ] Replace the vendors.
**Explanation:** Recurring vendor conflict often stems from unclear boundaries and responsibilities. Structural solutions (clear interfaces, objective criteria) prevent conflict better than repeated facilitation of the same issues.

## Question 45
A team member consistently arrives late to meetings, and other team members have started making passive-aggressive comments. The PM has not addressed this directly. What conflict management technique is the PM currently using?
- [ ] Smoothing
- [ ] Compromising
- [x] Avoiding
- [ ] Accommodating
**Explanation:** By not addressing the issue, the PM is avoiding the conflict. This allows secondary conflicts (passive-aggressive behavior) to develop and damages the PM's credibility as a leader.

## Question 46
A project manager successfully helps two team members resolve a significant conflict. What should the PM do in the following weeks?
- [ ] Consider the matter closed and move on.
- [ ] Keep the team members separated to prevent recurrence.
- [x] Follow up to ensure the resolution is holding and the working relationship is restored.
- [ ] Document lessons learned immediately.
**Explanation:** Conflict resolution requires follow-through. Checking in after resolution ensures the solution is working, demonstrates the PM's commitment, and catches any recurrence early.

## Question 47
During a heated project meeting, a stakeholder makes a personal attack against a team member, saying "Your incompetence is why we're in this mess." What should the PM do IMMEDIATELY?
- [ ] Let the team member defend themselves.
- [ ] Address the stakeholder's underlying concern about the project status.
- [x] Intervene to stop the personal attack and redirect to the issue, not the person.
- [ ] End the meeting immediately.
**Explanation:** The PM must protect team members from personal attacks. Allowing personal attacks damages psychological safety and the PM's credibility. Redirecting to the issue maintains professionalism.

## Question 48
A project manager is new to a team that has a history of unresolved conflicts and low trust. What should the PM prioritize FIRST to improve conflict management?
- [ ] Establish authority by making quick decisions on pending conflicts.
- [ ] Implement new conflict resolution processes.
- [x] Build relationships and psychological safety before addressing existing conflicts.
- [ ] Identify and remove the team members who cause the most conflict.
**Explanation:** Trust must precede effective conflict resolution. Without psychological safety, team members won't engage honestly in conflict resolution. Building relationships first enables sustainable improvement.

## Question 49
An experienced technical lead disagrees with a decision made by the project manager. The technical lead has valid points, but the decision has already been communicated to stakeholders. What is the BEST approach?
- [ ] Maintain the original decision to preserve credibility with stakeholders.
- [ ] Reverse the decision based on the technical lead's expertise.
- [x] Acknowledge the technical lead's perspective, evaluate the impact of changing course, and decide whether the benefits of change outweigh the costs.
- [ ] Ask the sponsor to make the final decision.
**Explanation:** Collaboration means genuinely considering input, even after decisions are made. Evaluating whether to change course (vs. defending the original decision) demonstrates respect and may lead to better outcomes.

## Question 50
Which of the following BEST describes the project manager's role in conflict management according to PMI?
- [ ] Judge who determines the correct resolution to disputes.
- [ ] Authority figure who enforces team compliance.
- [x] Facilitator who helps parties understand each other and find mutually acceptable solutions.
- [ ] Neutral observer who only intervenes when conflicts become severe.
**Explanation:** PMI emphasizes the PM as facilitator, not judge or authority. The PM's role is to create conditions for resolution, not to impose solutions. This aligns with servant leadership principles.
