# Task 4: Empower Team Members and Stakeholders
## EMPOWERMENT PERSPECTIVES (6 Scenarios)

---

## How This Activity Works

Experience empowerment situations from different viewpoints. Each scenario shows how the SAME situation feels different depending on whether someone is empowered or controlled, experienced or new. This builds empathy for how authority levels affect people and helps you recognize when empowerment is working—or failing.

---

## Scenario 1: The Technical Decision

**Situation:** A new feature requires choosing between two technical approaches. Both are viable. The team has a recommendation.

---

### Perspective A: The Empowered Developer

**Name:** Jordan | **Role:** Senior Developer | **Experience:** 6 years

**Internal Monologue:**

"We've been debating microservices versus monolith for the new feature. The team talked it through—we're going with microservices. It'll be more work upfront, but we've done the analysis, and it fits our scaling needs.

I told Sarah [PM] our recommendation this morning. She asked a few good questions about deployment complexity, which made me think harder about rollback scenarios. Then she said, 'Makes sense. It's your call—you're closer to the technical details than I am.'

That felt good. She trusted our judgment. And honestly, her questions made the decision better. I hadn't fully thought through the rollback scenario, so we added some safeguards.

I feel ownership over this. If it works, it's because WE made a good call. If it doesn't, I'll own that too—but I know Sarah will help us course-correct rather than blame us."

**What Jordan Experiences:**
- Trust and respect
- Ownership and pride
- Accountability accepted willingly
- PM as thought partner, not gatekeeper
- Confidence to make future decisions

---

### Perspective B: The Controlled Developer

**Name:** Jordan | **Role:** Senior Developer | **Experience:** 6 years

**Internal Monologue:**

"We've been debating microservices versus monolith for the new feature. The team talked it through—we want microservices. We wrote up a detailed recommendation and sent it to Sarah [PM] three days ago.

Still waiting for approval.

I followed up yesterday. She said she's 'reviewing it' and has some concerns about 'complexity' but hasn't had time to discuss. Meanwhile, we can't start the work.

This happens every time. We have the expertise. We've done the analysis. But every technical decision has to go through Sarah, and she's not even a developer. I don't think she understands the trade-offs as well as we do, but she's the bottleneck.

What's the point of having six years of experience if I can't make a technical call? I feel like a junior dev waiting for permission.

A few of us have been updating our LinkedIn profiles. If I wanted to just execute someone else's decisions, I could do that anywhere."

**What Jordan Experiences:**
- Frustration and disrespect
- Delayed work, wasted time
- Expertise not valued
- Infantilization despite experience
- Considering leaving

---

### Comparison Analysis

| Dimension | Empowered Jordan | Controlled Jordan |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Decision Time** | Same day | 3+ days and counting |
| **Ownership** | "OUR decision" | "Waiting for approval" |
| **PM Relationship** | Thought partner | Bottleneck |
| **Emotional State** | Pride, engagement | Frustration, disrespect |
| **Future Outlook** | Confident, committed | Updating LinkedIn |
| **Quality of Decision** | Improved by questions | Unchanged by delay |

**Key Insight:** Same person, same expertise, same recommendation. The difference is authority—and it changes everything about the experience and outcome.

---

## Scenario 2: The First-Time Lead

**Situation:** A team member is given their first leadership opportunity on a small project.

---

### Perspective A: The Supported First-Timer

**Name:** Priya | **Role:** Developer → First-time Project Lead | **Experience:** 3 years as developer

**Internal Monologue:**

"When Marcus [PM] offered me the lead role on the dashboard project, I was terrified and excited. I've never led anything.

But the way he set it up made me feel like I could do this. He said, 'You'll make the key decisions. I'll be your thought partner—not your approver. Check in with me when you want to talk something through, but I won't second-guess you.'

First week, I had to decide on the team's working hours for the project. I was going to ask Marcus, but then I remembered: this is MY call. So I proposed core hours to the team and asked what worked for them. We figured it out.

I did check in with Marcus about the vendor selection—that felt bigger. He asked good questions, helped me think through it, then said, 'Your call. What's your decision?' I chose Vendor B. He supported it.

The project delivered. Not perfectly—I made some scheduling mistakes early on. But Marcus helped me see them as learning, not failures. He said, 'Every lead makes those mistakes the first time. Now you won't make them again.'

I feel like I actually LED something. It wasn't Marcus's project that I executed. It was mine."

**What Priya Experiences:**
- Genuine ownership and growth
- Support without control
- Safe space to make mistakes
- Confidence building
- Identity shift (developer → leader)

---

### Perspective B: The Micromanaged First-Timer

**Name:** Priya | **Role:** Developer → First-time Project Lead | **Experience:** 3 years as developer

**Internal Monologue:**

"Marcus [PM] said I'm the 'lead' on the dashboard project, but it doesn't feel that way.

Every decision comes back to him. I proposed core hours for the team—he changed them. I recommended Vendor A—he overruled me and went with Vendor B. I tried to adjust the timeline when we hit an issue—he said no without explanation.

I've stopped making decisions. I just ask Marcus what he wants and do that. It's faster than proposing something just to have it overruled.

The worst part is, when I ask directly, he says, 'You're the lead, you decide!' But then when I decide, he undoes it. The message is clear: I'm 'lead' in name only.

The project is going fine, I guess. But I don't feel like I'm learning to lead. I'm learning to execute Marcus's vision while he pretends I'm in charge.

When people congratulate me on the project, I feel like a fraud. It wasn't really my work."

**What Priya Experiences:**
- Title without authority
- Confusion about actual role
- Learned helplessness
- Imposter syndrome
- No real development

---

### Comparison Analysis

| Dimension | Supported Priya | Micromanaged Priya |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Actual Authority** | Real decision rights | Title only |
| **PM Behavior** | Questions, supports | Overrules, controls |
| **Learning** | Growing as leader | Learning to comply |
| **Mistakes** | Treated as learning | Not allowed to make any |
| **Ownership Feeling** | "My project" | "His project, my name" |
| **Identity Development** | Developer → Leader | Stuck as executor |
| **Future Readiness** | Ready for next opportunity | Not developing |

**Key Insight:** Development requires real authority with real consequences. Fake delegation doesn't build capability—it builds cynicism.

---

## Scenario 3: The Self-Organizing Team

**Situation:** A mature agile team handles their sprint work.

---

### Perspective A: The Empowered Team

**Team Name:** Phoenix Squad | **Composition:** 5 developers, 1 QA, 1 designer | **Maturity:** 18 months together

**Team Internal Monologue:**

"Sprint planning took 45 minutes this morning. We know what we're doing.

Lisa [PM] wasn't even there. She checked in beforehand to see if we needed anything, but we said we were good. She trusts us to plan our own work.

During planning, we self-assigned the stories. Chen grabbed the complex API work—that's his strength. Mei and I are pairing on the frontend because we both want to learn. Akim took the performance story since he's been studying optimization.

No one told us who should do what. We figured it out because we know each other, we know our strengths, and we OWN this delivery.

Two days in, we hit an unexpected dependency. We talked about it in standup, decided to swap some work around, and adjusted. We told Lisa afterward. She said, 'Cool, sounds like you handled it.'

That's it. That's how it should work.

We've been together 18 months. We've delivered 15 sprints. We know when to pull Lisa in and when to handle it ourselves. She removes obstacles and deals with stakeholders. We deliver software. Everybody stays in their lane."

**What the Team Experiences:**
- True ownership
- Efficient planning (45 minutes)
- Flexibility to adjust
- PM as shield and servant
- Pride in team capability

---

### Perspective B: The Over-Managed Team

**Team Name:** Phoenix Squad | **Composition:** 5 developers, 1 QA, 1 designer | **Maturity:** 18 months together (but you wouldn't know it)

**Team Internal Monologue:**

"Sprint planning took three hours this morning. Again.

Lisa [PM] assigned all the stories. She has a spreadsheet that 'optimizes utilization.' Chen got the API work again because he's 'the API guy.' Mei wanted to try some backend, but Lisa said 'we can't afford learning time this sprint.'

No one argued. We've all tried. It doesn't change anything.

Two days in, we hit an unexpected dependency. We couldn't adjust without Lisa's approval—she was in meetings. So we sat on our hands for half a day. When she finally freed up, we spent 30 minutes explaining the situation and 15 minutes waiting for her to decide we should swap work around. We could have figured that out in 5 minutes.

The standup takes 45 minutes because Lisa asks follow-up questions about everything. 'Why did you approach it that way? Did you consider this alternative? What about that?'

We've been together 18 months. We've shipped 15 sprints. But we still get treated like we've never done this before. Last month, three of us applied for other jobs. Mei already accepted an offer.

We're not a team. We're Lisa's hands."

**What the Team Experiences:**
- No ownership despite tenure
- Inefficient planning (3 hours)
- Blocked waiting for PM
- PM as bottleneck and interrogator
- Resignations incoming

---

### Comparison Analysis

| Dimension | Empowered Team | Over-Managed Team |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Sprint Planning** | 45 minutes | 3 hours |
| **Task Assignment** | Self-selected | PM-assigned |
| **Problem Response** | Immediate adjustment | Wait for PM |
| **Standup Duration** | Brief | 45 minutes |
| **PM Role** | Shield, servant | Controller, interrogator |
| **Team Tenure Value** | Respected | Ignored |
| **Retention** | Stable | Losing members |

**Key Insight:** Experienced teams should get MORE autonomy over time, not the same level of oversight. Treating mature teams like novices drives them away.

---

## Scenario 4: The Failed Decision

**Situation:** Someone made an empowered decision that didn't work out.

---

### Perspective A: Learning-Oriented Response

**Name:** Alex | **Role:** Developer | **The Decision:** Chose a database configuration that caused performance issues

**Internal Monologue:**

"I made a call on the database config, and it backfired. Performance tanked in testing.

I was nervous to tell Kim [PM]. But when I did, she was calm. 'Okay, what happened? Walk me through your thinking.'

I explained my rationale. Kim nodded. 'That makes sense given what you knew. You didn't have the production load data—that's not your fault. What would you do differently now?'

We talked through it. I realized I should have simulated production load before committing. Kim said, 'Good learning. Can you fix it now?' I said yes. She said, 'Go.'

That was it. No blame. No 'you should have checked with me.' No taking away my authority to make future decisions.

Actually, she sent me a article later about database performance testing. Subject line: 'Thought you might find this interesting for next time.'

I feel bad the decision didn't work, but I don't feel bad about HAVING made a decision. That matters. I'll be smarter next time, but I won't be afraid to decide."

**What Alex Experiences:**
- Safe to admit failure
- Treated as learning
- No shame or punishment
- Authority maintained
- Growth through experience

---

### Perspective B: Blame-Oriented Response

**Name:** Alex | **Role:** Developer | **The Decision:** Chose a database configuration that caused performance issues

**Internal Monologue:**

"I made a call on the database config, and it backfired. Performance tanked in testing.

Kim [PM] was NOT happy. 'Why didn't you check with me first? This is exactly why I should be approving these decisions.'

I tried to explain my thinking. She cut me off. 'I don't want excuses. You should have known to escalate something this important.'

She called a team meeting to 'discuss what happened.' It felt like public humiliation. The takeaway was that technical decisions now need PM review.

I fixed the problem, but the damage was done. To my reputation. To my authority. To my confidence.

Now I check everything with Kim. EVERYTHING. I'm not getting blamed again. If she wants to make all the decisions, fine. I'll just execute.

The team noticed. A few people told me Kim was unfair. But privately, they're all being more careful too. Nobody wants to be the next example.

We used to move fast. Now everything crawls through Kim's approval queue. But hey, at least no one will get blamed."

**What Alex Experiences:**
- Public humiliation
- Blame and shame
- Authority revoked
- Fear of future decisions
- Team-wide chilling effect

---

### Comparison Analysis

| Dimension | Learning Response | Blame Response |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| **PM's First Question** | "What happened?" | "Why didn't you check with me?" |
| **Treatment** | Curiosity | Accusation |
| **Authority After** | Maintained | Revoked |
| **Future Behavior** | Smarter decisions | Avoid deciding |
| **Team Impact** | None | Fear spreads |
| **Speed Going Forward** | Unchanged | Slows down |

**Key Insight:** How you respond to failed empowered decisions determines whether empowerment survives. Blame kills it. Learning sustains it.

---

## Scenario 5: The Stakeholder Bypass

**Situation:** A stakeholder goes around the empowered team member to the PM.

---

### Perspective A: PM Protects Team Authority

**Name:** Marcus | **Role:** Technical Lead | **The Bypass:** VP went to PM instead of Marcus for a technical question

**Internal Monologue:**

"The VP called Sarah [PM] asking about our API architecture. I found out when Sarah pinged me: 'Hey, VP Chen asked me about the API. I told her you own that and she should talk to you directly. Just giving you a heads up—she might reach out.'

I appreciated that. Sarah didn't answer on my behalf. She didn't pretend to have technical expertise she doesn't. She redirected.

VP Chen did call me. A bit sheepishly—she said Sarah had pointed her my way. We had a good conversation. I could tell the VP was used to going to PMs, but now she knows: technical questions go to technical leads.

This is how it should work. I have authority. Sarah reinforces it. Even with senior stakeholders.

Two weeks later, VP Chen emailed me directly with a follow-up. Progress."

**What Marcus Experiences:**
- Authority protected
- PM as ally
- Stakeholder education
- Respect reinforced
- Future interactions improved

---

### Perspective B: PM Undermines Team Authority

**Name:** Marcus | **Role:** Technical Lead | **The Bypass:** VP went to PM instead of Marcus for a technical question

**Internal Monologue:**

"I found out at the steering committee that Sarah [PM] committed us to an architecture change. The VP had called her asking about the API, and Sarah said we could do it. She didn't tell me. She didn't ask. She just... decided.

When I talked to her after, she said, 'VP Chen needed an answer quickly. I didn't want to bother you.' BOTHER me? It's my domain! I'm supposed to own technical decisions!

Now the team is scrambling to implement an architecture change that wasn't thought through. When I raised concerns in the meeting, Sarah said, 'We already committed.'

The VP learned something from this: if you want technical decisions made quickly, go to Sarah, not Marcus.

Great. I'm the technical lead who doesn't control technical decisions. Very useful.

I've stopped investing in architecture decisions. Why bother? Sarah will override whatever I come up with the next time a VP calls."

**What Marcus Experiences:**
- Authority undermined
- PM as competitor
- Stakeholder learns wrong behavior
- Commitment made without owner
- Disengagement from role

---

### Comparison Analysis

| Dimension | PM Protects | PM Undermines |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **PM Response to Bypass** | Redirects to owner | Answers directly |
| **Team Authority** | Reinforced | Damaged |
| **Stakeholder Learning** | "Go to Marcus" | "Go to Sarah" |
| **Owner's Engagement** | High | Declining |
| **Future Pattern** | Proper channels | More bypassing |

**Key Insight:** When stakeholders bypass empowered team members, the PM's response either reinforces authority or destroys it. There's no neutral choice.

---

## Scenario 6: The Resource Request

**Situation:** An empowered team member needs resources to fulfill their accountability.

---

### Perspective A: Empowered with Resources

**Name:** Dana | **Role:** Project Lead | **The Need:** Additional contractor support for deadline

**Internal Monologue:**

"We're behind. I need two contractors for three weeks or we'll miss the launch. That costs about $45K.

I drafted the request and sent it to Michael [PM]. Within an hour, he responded: 'Makes sense. You're accountable for this launch, and you've identified what you need to deliver it. I'll get finance approval today. Anything else blocking you?'

That was it. No interrogation. No 'have you tried working harder?' He trusts my judgment because I have a track record.

I'm accountable for this launch. Michael gave me the AUTHORITY to request resources that fulfill that accountability. That's how it should work.

Contractors start Monday. We'll make the deadline."

**What Dana Experiences:**
- Authority matches accountability
- Trust in judgment
- Rapid response
- Empowered to solve problems
- Confidence to deliver

---

### Perspective B: Accountable Without Resources

**Name:** Dana | **Role:** Project Lead | **The Need:** Additional contractor support for deadline

**Internal Monologue:**

"We're behind. I need two contractors for three weeks or we'll miss the launch.

I've been asking Michael [PM] for three weeks. First he said 'let's see if you can catch up.' Then 'try reprioritizing.' Then 'can you work overtime instead?'

None of that worked. We're still behind. And now we're three weeks closer to launch with no help coming.

Finally, I got a meeting scheduled. Michael asked a million questions. 'Did you try pair programming? Did you ask for volunteers from other teams? Can you cut scope?'

Yes, yes, and already asked—sponsor said no. I've tried everything. I just need the contractors.

After all that, Michael said he'd 'escalate it to finance' but 'can't guarantee approval.' It's been a week. No answer.

If we miss the launch, guess who's accountable? Me. But did I have the authority to actually do something about it? No.

I've started documenting every request I've made, with dates. When this fails, I'm not taking the blame alone."

**What Dana Experiences:**
- Accountability without authority
- Obstacles instead of support
- Delays that guarantee failure
- Cover-your-ass documentation
- Trust breakdown

---

### Comparison Analysis

| Dimension | With Resources | Without Resources |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| **PM Response** | "Makes sense" | Interrogation |
| **Time to Decision** | 1 hour | 3+ weeks |
| **Trust Level** | High | Low |
| **Dana's Focus** | Solving the problem | Documenting protection |
| **Likely Outcome** | On-time delivery | Missed deadline + blame |
| **Future Relationship** | Strengthened | Damaged |

**Key Insight:** Accountability without authority to obtain resources is a setup for failure. Empowerment means providing what people need to succeed, not just blame when they don't.

---

## Key Takeaways from All Perspectives

### The Empowerment Experience

When people are genuinely empowered, they experience:
- Ownership and pride
- Trust and respect
- Willingness to take accountability
- Engagement and motivation
- Growth and development
- Commitment to the team and organization

### The Controlled Experience

When people are controlled despite capability, they experience:
- Frustration and resentment
- Disrespect and infantilization
- Avoidance of accountability
- Disengagement and cynicism
- Stagnation
- Consideration of leaving

### The PM's Choice

Every empowerment interaction is a choice:
- Trust or control?
- Support or obstruct?
- Learn or blame?
- Protect authority or undermine it?
- Provide resources or create barriers?

The choice determines not just the outcome, but the relationship, the culture, and the team's future.

## END OF EMPOWERMENT PERSPECTIVES
