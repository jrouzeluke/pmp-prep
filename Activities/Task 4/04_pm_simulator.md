# Task 4: Empower Team Members and Stakeholders
## PM SIMULATOR (8 Scenarios)

---

## How This Activity Works

You'll face realistic project scenarios involving empowerment, delegation, and team autonomy. For each situation, choose the best response. Focus on matching authority to capability, enabling self-organization, and avoiding both micromanagement and abdication.

---

## Scenario 1: The Bottleneck PM

**Situation:**

You've been managing a software development project for six months. Your team of eight experienced developers has a strong track record. However, you've noticed that decisions are piling up waiting for your approval—technical approach choices, tool selections, process adjustments. Team members often wait 1-2 days for your response because you're in meetings. Sprint velocity has dropped 20% over the past two sprints.

During the retrospective, the tech lead says: "We spend more time waiting for approvals than actually building. We know what we're doing—we just need permission to do it."

**What should you do?**

**Options:**

A) Acknowledge the feedback and commit to faster response times on approval requests

B) Create a decision rights matrix that defines which decisions the team can make independently, which require informing you, and which need your approval

C) Delegate all technical decisions to the tech lead so there's a single point of contact

D) Schedule daily decision meetings where the team can get rapid approvals on pending items

**Best Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

The root cause isn't slow approvals—it's unnecessary approvals. An experienced team shouldn't need PM permission for most technical decisions. Option B addresses this systemically by creating clear boundaries: team decides X independently, informs you of Y, and escalates Z. This eliminates the bottleneck while maintaining appropriate oversight for high-impact decisions.

Option A treats the symptom (slow response) not the disease (unnecessary approvals). Option C over-concentrates authority in one person. Option D institutionalizes the bottleneck rather than removing it.

**Key Principle:** Define decision rights explicitly. Don't require approval for decisions the team is qualified to make.

## Scenario 2: The Nervous New Hire

**Situation:**

Marcus joined your team three weeks ago as a junior business analyst. He has relevant education but limited practical experience. You assigned him to gather requirements for a small module—something manageable for his skill level.

Marcus has been asking questions constantly—sometimes 8-10 times per day. Questions range from "Should I use this template?" to "Is it okay to schedule a meeting with this stakeholder?" to "What format should the document be?" Your other team members are starting to get pulled into answering his questions too.

Yesterday, Marcus said: "I just want to make sure I'm doing everything right. I don't want to mess anything up."

**What should you do?**

**Options:**

A) Tell Marcus he's empowered to make these decisions himself and should only come to you with significant issues

B) Pair Marcus with a senior BA who can provide guidance and gradually transfer decision-making to him

C) Create detailed documentation of exactly how tasks should be done so Marcus has clear guidance

D) Have a conversation with Marcus about which decisions he can make independently and which warrant checking in

**Best Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

Marcus is at the "low competence, high commitment" stage (D1 in Situational Leadership). He needs direction—but constant PM direction isn't sustainable. Pairing him with a senior BA provides the guidance he needs while building his capability and confidence over time. The senior BA can progressively transfer decision authority as Marcus demonstrates competence.

Option A gives too much autonomy too fast—he'll either freeze or make avoidable mistakes. Option C creates dependency on documentation rather than building judgment. Option D is partially right but doesn't provide the ongoing support structure Marcus needs.

**Key Principle:** Match delegation level to capability. New team members need more direction initially, with progressive empowerment as they demonstrate competence.

## Scenario 3: The Micromanaged Expert

**Situation:**

Priya is your most experienced developer with 12 years of expertise in the exact technology stack your project uses. She's consistently delivered high-quality work and has saved the project multiple times with her deep technical knowledge.

Recently, your organization implemented a new governance process requiring PM approval on all technical design decisions. You've been reviewing Priya's designs and approving them without changes—they're always solid. But the review cycle adds 2-3 days to each decision.

Priya requests a meeting and says: "I understand the new process, but I feel like I'm being treated like a junior developer. You approve everything I submit without changes. Can we find a different approach?"

**What should you do?**

**Options:**

A) Explain that the governance process applies to everyone equally and you can't make exceptions

B) Propose to leadership that proven senior technical staff be exempt from the approval requirement for decisions within their expertise

C) Continue the approval process but commit to 24-hour turnaround to minimize delays

D) Ask Priya to document her decisions more thoroughly so leadership has visibility without requiring approval

**Best Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

Priya is right—the process doesn't match her capability level. When approvals are rubber-stamps, they add delay without value. The PM's role includes advocating for appropriate processes. Proposing an exemption for proven experts (with clear criteria) addresses the legitimate governance concern while empowering capable professionals.

Option A enforces a process that's demonstrably inappropriate for this situation. Option C reduces but doesn't eliminate unnecessary friction. Option D adds work for Priya without addressing the authority mismatch.

**Key Principle:** Advocate for empowerment. When processes prevent capable people from being effective, work to change the processes.

## Scenario 4: The Self-Organizing Struggle

**Situation:**

Your Scrum team has been together for four months. They're technically capable but haven't fully embraced self-organization. During sprint planning, they look to you to assign tasks. In daily standups, they report to you rather than each other. When problems arise, they wait for you to solve them.

You've tried saying "You decide" and "The team should figure this out," but they seem uncomfortable and decisions take longer when you step back.

The Scrum Master mentions: "They're used to being told what to do. They have the skills, but not the confidence to own decisions."

**What should you do?**

**Options:**

A) Continue directing the team since that's what they're comfortable with and it's more efficient

B) Force self-organization by refusing to make any decisions and requiring the team to figure everything out

C) Gradually transfer decision authority by starting with low-risk decisions, celebrating successes, and expanding scope over time

D) Send the team to agile training so they understand how self-organizing teams are supposed to work

**Best Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

The team is in transition—they have capability but lack confidence in self-organization. This requires a gradual approach: start with decisions where failure is low-cost, let them experience success, build confidence, then expand. Forcing immediate self-organization (Option B) will create anxiety and poor decisions. Continuing to direct (Option A) perpetuates dependency.

Option D assumes knowledge is the gap—but they likely understand self-organization conceptually; they lack experience and confidence in practice.

**Key Principle:** Build self-organization progressively. Start small, celebrate wins, expand authority as confidence grows.

## Scenario 5: The Authority Gap

**Situation:**

You assigned Chen to lead the vendor integration workstream. He's accountable for delivering the integration on time and within budget. However, Chen keeps running into obstacles:

- He can't approve vendor invoices over $5,000 (most are $8,000-15,000)
- He can't access the production environment to verify integration points
- He can't schedule meetings with the vendor's technical team without going through procurement
- He can't make scope decisions without your approval

Chen is frustrated: "You made me responsible for this, but I can't actually do anything without asking permission. I spend more time getting approvals than doing the work."

**What should you do?**

**Options:**

A) Acknowledge the constraints and commit to faster approvals to reduce Chen's delays

B) Work with finance, IT, and procurement to get Chen the access and authority he needs to fulfill his accountability

C) Take back ownership of the vendor integration since the organizational constraints make delegation impractical

D) Escalate to your sponsor that organizational processes are blocking project progress

**Best Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

This is a classic "responsibility without authority" failure. Chen was given accountability but not the matching authority. The PM's job is to fix this—work across the organization to get Chen what he needs. This might mean temporary spending authority, system access, and direct vendor contact rights.

Option A doesn't solve the problem—it just makes the PM a faster bottleneck. Option C gives up on empowerment rather than fixing the setup. Option D might be needed eventually, but first try to solve it at your level.

**Key Principle:** Responsibility must come with authority. If someone is accountable for results, ensure they have the power to achieve those results.

## Scenario 6: The Stakeholder Bypass

**Situation:**

Your team has been empowered to make technical decisions within their domain. You've communicated this to stakeholders and it's been working well for two months.

However, a senior VP has started coming directly to you with technical questions and requests. When you redirect her to the technical lead (Jamal), she says: "I'd rather deal with the PM. Can't you just tell me?"

You've noticed that when the VP does talk to Jamal, she sometimes overrides his recommendations and tells him what to do. Jamal mentioned: "I don't feel like I have real authority. The VP just goes around me anyway."

**What should you do?**

**Options:**

A) Handle the VP's requests yourself since she's senior and her preference should be accommodated

B) Have a private conversation with the VP explaining the team's decision authority and asking her to work through Jamal for technical matters

C) Attend meetings with Jamal and the VP to provide support and ensure the VP respects his authority

D) Escalate to your sponsor that the VP is undermining team empowerment

**Best Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

The PM must protect team authority. A direct, respectful conversation with the VP is the appropriate first step. Explain the reasoning (faster decisions, Jamal's expertise, team ownership) and ask for her partnership. Most executives will respect clear boundaries when the rationale is explained.

Option A undermines the empowerment you established. Option C creates a crutch rather than solving the issue. Option D escalates before attempting direct resolution.

**Key Principle:** Defend team authority. When stakeholders bypass empowered team members, redirect them and reinforce the team's decision rights.

## Scenario 7: The Failed Delegation

**Situation:**

Two weeks ago, you delegated ownership of the testing strategy to Sam, a senior QA engineer. You told him: "You own this—make it happen." You've been focused on other priorities and haven't checked in.

Today, you learned that the testing strategy is significantly behind. Sam made several decisions that created problems:
- He chose a testing tool that doesn't integrate with your CI/CD pipeline
- He committed to test coverage levels the team can't achieve in the timeline
- He didn't coordinate with developers on testability requirements

Sam is defensive: "You said I owned it. I made the decisions I thought were right."

**What should you do?**

**Options:**

A) Take back ownership of the testing strategy and fix the problems yourself

B) Hold Sam accountable for the failures and document the performance issue

C) Acknowledge that you didn't provide enough context and support, work with Sam to course-correct, and establish better checkpoints going forward

D) Keep Sam in the lead role but review all his decisions before implementation going forward

**Best Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

This is a delegation failure, not a Sam failure. "You own this—make it happen" without context, boundaries, or checkpoints is abdication, not delegation. Sam didn't know about CI/CD requirements, timeline constraints, or the need to coordinate with developers because you didn't tell him.

The right response: own your part, fix it together, and establish proper delegation structure (clear expectations, defined boundaries, appropriate checkpoints) for the path forward.

Option A punishes Sam for your setup failure. Option B blames Sam unfairly. Option D swings to micromanagement rather than proper delegation.

**Key Principle:** Delegation requires setup. When delegation fails, examine whether you provided clear expectations, necessary context, appropriate boundaries, and reasonable checkpoints.

## Scenario 8: The Empowerment Success

**Situation:**

Six months ago, your team struggled with dependency on PM decisions. Through deliberate effort—defining decision rights, progressive delegation, celebrating autonomous decisions—the team has transformed. They now:

- Self-assign work during sprint planning
- Make technical decisions without PM approval
- Resolve most conflicts internally
- Proactively identify and address risks
- Deliver consistently with high quality

Your role has shifted to stakeholder management, obstacle removal, and strategic planning. The team rarely needs you for day-to-day decisions.

Your manager asks: "The team seems to run itself. What exactly do you do now?"

**How should you respond?**

**Options:**

A) Explain that you've worked yourself out of the day-to-day by building a high-performing, self-organizing team—and that's exactly the goal

B) Start being more visible in team activities so leadership sees your involvement

C) Take on additional project responsibilities to demonstrate your value

D) Document all the behind-the-scenes work you do so leadership understands your contribution

**Best Answer: A**

**Explanation:**

This is empowerment success! A PM who builds a self-organizing team and focuses on strategic work is doing exactly what they should. Be confident in articulating this: "I've built a team that doesn't need me for daily decisions. That frees me to focus on stakeholder alignment, risk management, and removing organizational obstacles. The team's performance is the evidence of effective leadership."

Option B undermines the empowerment you built. Option C might be appropriate but isn't the answer to this question. Option D is defensive rather than confident.

**Key Principle:** Empowerment success means less visible PM involvement. A quiet PM with a high-performing team is doing it right.
