# Task 4: Empower Team Members and Stakeholders
## LIGHTNING ROUND (25 Questions / 5 Rounds)

---

## How This Activity Works

Answer 25 rapid-fire questions about empowerment, delegation, and team autonomy. Questions are organized into 5 rounds of 5 questions each. Focus on quick recognition of empowerment principles and PMI's perspective on authority distribution.

---

# ROUND 1: Delegation Fundamentals

## Question 1
A project manager assigns a task to a team member but doesn't give them access to the systems needed to complete it. What empowerment element is missing?

A) Accountability
B) Authority
C) Autonomy
D) Recognition

**Answer: B**
**Explanation:** Authority includes the resources, access, and decision rights needed to complete assigned work. Responsibility without matching authority sets people up for failure.

---

## Question 2
In a RACI matrix, how many people should be assigned as "Accountable" for a single task?

A) At least one
B) Exactly one
C) One or two
D) As many as needed

**Answer: B**
**Explanation:** There must be exactly ONE person Accountable per task. Multiple accountable parties means no one truly owns the outcome. "When everyone is accountable, no one is accountable."

---

## Question 3
A highly experienced team member asks the PM for approval on a routine technical decision they've made successfully many times before. What should the PM do?

A) Approve the decision to maintain the relationship
B) Empower them to make these decisions independently going forward
C) Ask why they need approval for something routine
D) Document the pattern and address it in their performance review

**Answer: B**
**Explanation:** This signals unnecessary dependency. The PM should break the pattern by explicitly delegating authority for routine decisions the team member has proven capable of handling.

---

## Question 4
What is the difference between delegation and abdication?

A) Delegation involves senior staff; abdication involves junior staff
B) Delegation maintains accountability; abdication abandons it
C) Delegation is formal; abdication is informal
D) Delegation is temporary; abdication is permanent

**Answer: B**
**Explanation:** Delegation transfers authority while maintaining appropriate oversight and accountability. Abdication is abandoning responsibility—"figure it out yourself" with no support, no checkpoints, no accountability structure.

---

## Question 5
According to Situational Leadership, what delegation approach is best for a team member with high competence and high commitment?

A) Directing (Tell)
B) Coaching (Sell)
C) Supporting (Participate)
D) Delegating (Entrust)

**Answer: D**
**Explanation:** High competence + high commitment = D4 in Situational Leadership. This person is ready for full delegation—they have both the skill and motivation to own outcomes independently.

---

# ROUND 2: Self-Organizing Teams

## Question 6
In an agile environment, who decides HOW the work will be done?

A) The Project Manager
B) The Product Owner
C) The Development Team
D) The Scrum Master

**Answer: C**
**Explanation:** Self-organizing teams own the "how." The Product Owner decides WHAT to build (priority), but the team decides HOW to build it, including task distribution, technical approach, and process.

---

## Question 7
A stakeholder asks the PM to assign specific tasks to individual developers during sprint planning. What should the PM do?

A) Assign tasks based on each developer's strengths
B) Explain that the team self-assigns work and facilitate that process
C) Ask the team if they prefer PM assignment or self-assignment
D) Compromise by assigning critical tasks and letting the team assign the rest

**Answer: B**
**Explanation:** Agile teams self-organize. The PM should protect this principle by explaining it to stakeholders and facilitating team-based task selection rather than imposing assignments.

---

## Question 8
A mature Scrum team wants to change their Definition of Done. What should the Scrum Master do?

A) Approve the change if it maintains quality standards
B) Reject the change to maintain consistency
C) Support the team in making this decision themselves
D) Escalate to the Product Owner for approval

**Answer: C**
**Explanation:** The Definition of Done belongs to the team. A mature, self-organizing team should own their quality standards. The Scrum Master supports but doesn't approve or reject—the team decides.

---

## Question 9
What is the PM's primary role with a high-performing, self-organizing team?

A) Directing daily work activities
B) Making technical decisions
C) Removing obstacles and managing stakeholders
D) Approving team decisions

**Answer: C**
**Explanation:** With self-organizing teams, the PM shifts from directing to enabling. Primary focus becomes removing organizational obstacles, managing stakeholder relationships, and handling strategic issues—not daily task direction.

---

## Question 10
A team has been together for two months and is technically capable, but they still wait for PM direction on most decisions. What stage of self-organization are they likely in?

A) Fully self-organizing
B) Dependent
C) Counter-dependent
D) Interdependent

**Answer: B**
**Explanation:** Dependent teams wait for direction even when capable. They haven't yet developed confidence in autonomous decision-making. The PM should progressively build their self-organization through gradual authority transfer.

---

# ROUND 3: Authority and Accountability

## Question 11
A team member was delegated responsibility for a deliverable but made decisions that caused problems. The PM had provided no guidance, checkpoints, or boundaries. Who is primarily responsible for the failure?

A) The team member who made poor decisions
B) The PM who delegated without proper setup
C) Both equally
D) The sponsor who approved the delegation

**Answer: B**
**Explanation:** Delegation without clear expectations, boundaries, and checkpoints is abdication. The PM failed to set up the team member for success. Poor delegation setup is a PM failure, not a team member failure.

---

## Question 12
What does "progressive delegation" mean?

A) Delegating to progressively more senior team members
B) Gradually increasing authority as capability is demonstrated
C) Moving through delegation levels in sequence
D) Delegating larger tasks over time

**Answer: B**
**Explanation:** Progressive delegation means starting with limited authority, verifying success, then expanding. It builds trust and capability incrementally rather than giving full autonomy before it's earned.

---

## Question 13
A PM reviews every deliverable before it goes to stakeholders, even from senior team members with perfect track records. This is an example of:

A) Quality assurance
B) Due diligence
C) Micromanagement
D) Risk management

**Answer: C**
**Explanation:** Reviewing everything regardless of track record is micromanagement. It signals distrust, creates bottlenecks, and wastes senior talent. Review should be risk-based—more oversight for unproven work, less for proven performers.

---

## Question 14
What is the relationship between authority and accountability?

A) Authority should exceed accountability
B) Accountability should exceed authority
C) Authority and accountability should be matched
D) They are independent of each other

**Answer: C**
**Explanation:** Authority and accountability must be balanced. Accountability without authority creates frustration (responsible but powerless). Authority without accountability creates chaos (power without consequences).

---

## Question 15
A team member succeeds with a delegated decision. What should the PM do?

A) Document the success for the performance review
B) Recognize the success and consider expanding their authority
C) Verify they followed the correct process
D) Thank them and move on to other priorities

**Answer: B**
**Explanation:** Success with delegated authority should be recognized AND used to expand empowerment. Each success builds the case for more autonomy. Positive reinforcement encourages ownership.

---

# ROUND 4: Empowerment Challenges

## Question 16
A senior VP bypasses the empowered technical lead and comes directly to the PM with technical requests. What should the PM do FIRST?

A) Handle the requests to maintain the executive relationship
B) Redirect the VP to the technical lead for technical matters
C) Escalate to the sponsor about the VP's behavior
D) Attend meetings with the VP and tech lead together

**Answer: B**
**Explanation:** The PM must protect team authority. First step is direct redirection—explain that the tech lead owns technical decisions and route the VP appropriately. Don't enable the bypass by handling it yourself.

---

## Question 17
A PM tells a team member "you're empowered to decide" but then overrules their decision. What is this called?

A) Course correction
B) Quality control
C) False empowerment
D) Risk mitigation

**Answer: C**
**Explanation:** Saying "you decide" then overruling creates false empowerment. It damages trust and teaches the team that empowerment isn't real. If the PM needs approval rights, be clear about it upfront.

---

## Question 18
A team member makes a reasonable but ultimately wrong decision after being empowered. What should the PM do?

A) Revoke their decision-making authority
B) Coach them through what went wrong without removing authority
C) Document the failure for future reference
D) Take over the decision area to prevent future issues

**Answer: B**
**Explanation:** Reasonable decisions that don't work out are learning opportunities, not authority revocation triggers. Coach through the analysis, help them improve, maintain empowerment. Removing authority for honest mistakes kills empowerment culture.

---

## Question 19
What is the main risk of giving a new team member full decision-making authority immediately?

A) They might make better decisions than the PM
B) They lack the context and experience to make good decisions
C) Other team members might be jealous
D) It violates organizational policy

**Answer: B**
**Explanation:** New team members lack organizational context, relationship knowledge, and domain experience. Full authority too early leads to avoidable mistakes. Match authority to demonstrated capability.

---

## Question 20
A PM notices they are the bottleneck for all decisions. What is the BEST solution?

A) Work longer hours to process decisions faster
B) Hire an assistant to help manage the decision queue
C) Define which decisions the team can make independently
D) Schedule daily decision meetings to batch approvals

**Answer: C**
**Explanation:** Being a bottleneck means too many decisions require PM involvement. The solution is reducing what needs approval—define decision rights so the team can act independently on appropriate matters. Don't optimize the bottleneck; eliminate it.

---

# ROUND 5: PMI Perspective and Exam Focus

## Question 21
According to PMI, what leadership approach is most aligned with team empowerment?

A) Directive leadership
B) Transactional leadership
C) Servant leadership
D) Authoritarian leadership

**Answer: C**
**Explanation:** Servant leadership focuses on serving the team's ability to deliver. It emphasizes removing obstacles, developing people, and enabling success—core empowerment principles. PMI strongly favors servant leadership.

---

## Question 22
In the PMI framework, the Empowerment Triangle consists of which three elements?

A) Authority, Accountability, Autonomy
B) Responsibility, Resources, Recognition
C) Delegation, Direction, Development
D) Trust, Training, Tools

**Answer: A**
**Explanation:** The Empowerment Triangle: Authority (right to decide), Accountability (ownership of outcomes), Autonomy (freedom to choose approach). All three must be present for true empowerment.

---

## Question 23
On the PMP exam, if a question describes an experienced team being micromanaged, the correct answer will likely involve:

A) Documenting the micromanagement for the lessons learned
B) Increasing the team's decision-making authority
C) Training the PM on leadership styles
D) Escalating to the sponsor

**Answer: B**
**Explanation:** PMI favors empowerment. When capable teams are over-controlled, the answer typically involves increasing delegation, reducing oversight, or expanding decision authority. Match authority to capability.

---

## Question 24
A question describes "responsibility without authority." What is PMI's expected response?

A) Accept the organizational constraints
B) Provide the authority to match the responsibility
C) Reduce the responsibility to match available authority
D) Document the mismatch and continue

**Answer: B**
**Explanation:** PMI expects PMs to resolve authority gaps. When someone is accountable for results, ensure they have the power, access, and resources to achieve those results. Fix the mismatch; don't accept it.

---

## Question 25
What distinguishes a high-performing team from a functional team regarding empowerment?

A) High-performing teams have more authority
B) High-performing teams need less PM involvement in decisions
C) High-performing teams have bigger budgets
D) High-performing teams have more experienced members

**Answer: B**
**Explanation:** High-performing teams self-organize and make decisions autonomously. The PM's involvement shifts from directing to enabling. Less PM involvement in daily decisions is a marker of team maturity and empowerment success.
