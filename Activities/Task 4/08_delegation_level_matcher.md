# Task 4: Empower Team Members and Stakeholders
## DELEGATION LEVEL MATCHER (12 Situations)

---

## How This Activity Works

Match each scenario to the appropriate delegation level. Consider the team member's capability, the decision's risk/impact, and contextual factors. Each situation requires you to choose the right level of authority to grant.

---

## The Four Delegation Levels

| Level | Name | PM Does | Team Does | Use When |
|-------|------|---------|-----------|----------|
| **1** | **DIRECT (Tell)** | Decides and directs specifically | Executes as directed | Low skill, high stakes, crisis |
| **2** | **COACH (Sell)** | Decides and explains reasoning | Executes with understanding | Building capability, moderate risk |
| **3** | **SUPPORT (Participate)** | Facilitates, provides input | Decides with PM involvement | High skill, variable confidence |
| **4** | **DELEGATE (Entrust)** | Stays available if needed | Full ownership and authority | Proven capability, appropriate scope |

### Answer: Level 1 — DIRECT (Tell)

**Why:**
- First real task = no track record
- Strong theory but no practical experience
- Needs to learn organizational norms and standards
- Low-risk task but formative experience

**What to Do:**
"Maya, here's what I need: Create test cases for the login feature. Use our standard template (here it is). Cover these specific scenarios: [list]. Aim for 15-20 test cases. Check in with me tomorrow afternoon so I can review your progress and answer questions."

**Goal:** Set her up for success. Direct now so you can delegate later.

### Answer: Level 4 — DELEGATE (Entrust)

**Why:**
- Three years of proven track record
- Four successful migrations
- Zero incidents = demonstrated judgment
- Within his domain of expertise

**What to Do:**
"Derek, you own the architecture for this migration. Make the calls you think are right. I'd like a quick brief once you have a direction, but that's for my awareness, not my approval. Let me know if you hit any organizational obstacles I can help clear."

**Goal:** Trust earned through performance. Don't waste his time or yours with unnecessary oversight.

## Situation 3: The Risky Decision

**Context:**
Your team is highly capable and has been self-organizing effectively for months. They want to adopt a new CI/CD tool that would require migrating all existing pipelines. The decision is technically complex and would affect three other teams.

**The Decision:** Should we switch CI/CD tools and how should we implement it?

**Match to Delegation Level:** ___

### Answer: Level 3 — SUPPORT (Participate)

**Why:**
- Team is capable (could delegate normally)
- BUT: High impact decision (affects 3 teams)
- Cross-functional implications require coordination
- PM can add value on organizational navigation

**What to Do:**
"I trust your technical judgment on the tools. Let's work through this together—you evaluate the technical options, I'll help navigate the cross-team implications. Final call on whether to proceed is yours, but let's make sure we've considered the broader impact together."

**Goal:** Capable team + high-impact decision = participate together. Don't take over, but don't be absent either.

## Situation 4: The Struggling Performer

**Context:**
Raj has been on the team for a year. Lately, his work quality has declined—missed details, incomplete deliverables, uncharacteristic mistakes. You've had one coaching conversation but haven't seen improvement yet.

**The Decision:** How to approach the next assigned feature?

**Match to Delegation Level:** ___

### Answer: Level 2 — COACH (Sell)

**Why:**
- Has capability (year of experience, previous good work)
- Currently struggling (recent decline)
- Needs closer support without micromanaging
- Need to understand root cause while providing structure

**What to Do:**
"Raj, here's the approach I'd like you to take for this feature, and let me explain why: [specifics]. I want to set you up for success here. Let's check in at the end of each day this week so I can help you stay on track. What's going on for you that might be affecting things?"

**Goal:** Coach through the rough patch. Direct enough to ensure success, supportive enough to help recover.

## Situation 5: The Confident Junior

**Context:**
Aisha has been on the team for four months and has picked things up quickly. She's eager and confident—sometimes overconfident. She just volunteered to handle a stakeholder negotiation that typically requires senior experience.

**The Decision:** How should the stakeholder negotiation be approached?

**Match to Delegation Level:** ___

<details>
<summary>Click for Answer</summary>

### Answer: Level 2 — COACH (Sell)

**Why:**
- Four months = still developing
- Eager and confident (good!)
- But possibly overconfident for this specific task
- Stakeholder negotiation = high visibility, relationship risk
- Good learning opportunity with appropriate support

**What to Do:**
"Aisha, I love that you volunteered for this. Here's my recommended approach based on what I know about this stakeholder: [specifics]. I want you to lead it, but let's role-play the conversation first. I'll observe the actual meeting and we'll debrief after."

**Goal:** Channel enthusiasm into learning. Don't crush confidence, but ensure appropriate preparation for high-stakes situation.

## Situation 6: The Crisis Situation

**Context:**
Production is down. Customers are impacted. The CEO is asking for updates every 15 minutes. Your team is highly experienced and knows the system well, but emotions are running high and multiple people are shouting different theories about the cause.

**The Decision:** How do we diagnose and fix the production issue?

**Match to Delegation Level:** ___

<details>
<summary>Click for Answer</summary>

### Answer: Level 1 — DIRECT (Tell)

**Why:**
- Crisis = no time for consensus-building
- Chaos = need single point of coordination
- High stakes = wrong decision is very costly
- Even experienced teams need direction in crisis

**What to Do:**
"Stop. Here's what we're doing: Chen, you own database investigation—report in 5 minutes. Priya, you're on network. Marcus, check application logs. Everyone else, stay off the production server. I'll coordinate communication. We'll sync every 10 minutes in this channel. Go."

**Goal:** Crisis leadership. Cut through chaos, assign clear roles, maintain coordination. Return to normal delegation when crisis passes.

## Situation 7: The Routine Decision

**Context:**
Your team has been self-organizing effectively. A team member asks whether they should use JSON or XML for a configuration file format. There's no strong organizational standard, and either works fine.

**The Decision:** JSON or XML for config files?

**Match to Delegation Level:** ___

<details>

### Answer: Level 4 — DELEGATE (Entrust)

**Why:**
- Team is self-organizing
- Low-impact decision
- No significant constraints
- Team member is asking out of habit, not necessity

**What to Do:**
"You know what? You should decide this. It's your code. Use whatever makes more sense for the use case. You don't need my input on this."

**Goal:** Break dependency on unnecessary approval. Teach team that routine decisions are theirs.

## Situation 8: The Stretch Assignment

**Context:**
Kim is ready for growth. She's been a solid performer for two years and has expressed interest in technical leadership. A medium-complexity project needs a technical lead—normally you'd assign a senior, but this could be Kim's development opportunity.

**The Decision:** How should the technical work be organized and led?

**Match to Delegation Level:** ___

<details>
<summary>Click for Answer</summary>

### Answer: Level 3 — SUPPORT (Participate)

**Why:**
- Development opportunity = some risk accepted
- First time in role = needs support structure
- Solid performer = has earned the chance
- Medium complexity = bounded risk

**What to Do:**
"Kim, I want you to lead this technically. You'll make the key decisions, but I'll be your thought partner—let's talk through major choices together. I won't override you unless there's a serious issue. Check in with me twice a week, and come to me anytime you're stuck."

**Goal:** Stretch + support. Enough autonomy to grow, enough backup to succeed.

## Situation 9: The External Constraint

**Context:**
Your team wants to adopt a new testing framework. They've researched it thoroughly and are confident it's the right choice. However, your organization has a Technology Standards Board that must approve new tools, and the process takes 6-8 weeks.

**The Decision:** Should the team adopt the new testing framework?

**Match to Delegation Level:** ___

<details>
<summary>Click for Answer</summary>

### Answer: Level 3 — SUPPORT (Participate)

**Why:**
- Team made a good recommendation
- But organizational process exists for a reason
- PM needs to navigate the approval process
- Team can't bypass governance unilaterally

**What to Do:**
"Great analysis on the testing framework. I agree it's the right technical choice. Here's the reality: we need Standards Board approval. Let's work together—you prepare the technical justification, I'll handle the politics and scheduling. Your recommendation drives this, but we need to go through the process."

**Goal:** Support team decision through organizational constraints. PM adds value by navigating bureaucracy.

## Situation 10: The Reversible Experiment

**Context:**
Your agile team wants to try a new retrospective format they read about. It's a bit unconventional but interesting. The "risk" is that one retrospective might not be as productive as usual.

**The Decision:** Should the team try the new retrospective format?

**Match to Delegation Level:** ___

<details>
<summary>Click for Answer</summary>

### Answer: Level 4 — DELEGATE (Entrust)

**Why:**
- Low risk (one retro)
- Fully reversible (can go back next sprint)
- Team process = team decision
- Learning opportunity even if it doesn't work

**What to Do:**
"Try it. It's your retrospective. If it works, great. If not, you'll learn something. Let me know how it goes."

**Goal:** Empower experimentation. Reversible, low-risk changes don't need permission.

</details>

## Situation 11: The Interpersonal Conflict

**Context:**
Two team members are having a conflict that's starting to affect team dynamics. One has complained to you privately. Both are experienced professionals, and you've encouraged them to work it out directly, but it's not improving.

**The Decision:** How to resolve the conflict between team members?

**Match to Delegation Level:** ___

<details>
<summary>Click for Answer</summary>

### Answer: Level 2 — COACH (Sell)

**Why:**
- Direct resolution was attempted and failed
- Conflict is escalating
- PM intervention now appropriate
- Need to guide without taking over entirely

**What to Do:**
"I've watched you both try to work this out, and I appreciate the effort. Here's what I think we need to do: [specific approach—maybe a facilitated conversation, clear working agreements, or defined boundaries]. Let me explain why I think this will help. I'll facilitate, but you both own making it work."

**Goal:** Step in when self-resolution fails. Coach through conflict, don't dictate the outcome.

</details>

---

## Situation 12: The Expert Disagreement

**Context:**
Two senior technical experts on your team disagree about the right approach for a complex feature. Both have strong track records. Both have valid technical arguments. The team is stuck waiting for resolution.

**The Decision:** Which technical approach should be used?

**Match to Delegation Level:** ___

<details>
<summary>Click for Answer</summary>

### Answer: Level 3 — SUPPORT (Participate)

**Why:**
- Both experts are capable (normally would delegate)
- But they're deadlocked
- Team is stuck, need resolution
- PM can facilitate, add decision criteria, break tie if needed

**What to Do:**
"You're both making valid points. Let's structure this: What are the key criteria we should use to decide? What's the risk profile of each approach? If you had to identify the ONE biggest concern with the other option, what is it? [Facilitate discussion] If you still can't agree after this, I'll make the call—but I want your best input first."

**Goal:** Facilitate expert resolution. PM breaks tie only if necessary, doesn't substitute judgment for expertise.

## Key Principles for Delegation Level Matching

**1. Capability determines baseline:**
- Low capability → Direct or Coach
- High capability → Support or Delegate

**2. Risk/Impact adjusts level:**
- Higher risk → More involvement (move down)
- Lower risk → Less involvement (move up)

**3. Context matters:**
- Crisis → Direct regardless of capability
- Development opportunity → Support with safety net
- Organizational constraints → Support to navigate

**4. When in doubt:**
- Err toward more delegation with experienced people
- Err toward more structure with developing people
