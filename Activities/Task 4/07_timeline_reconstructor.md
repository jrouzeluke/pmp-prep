# Task 4: Empower Team Members and Stakeholders
## TIMELINE RECONSTRUCTOR (15 Events)

---

## How This Activity Works

A project team's journey from dependency to empowerment has been scrambled. Your job is to arrange the events in the correct sequence, then analyze the empowerment transformation. This timeline shows how a PM deliberately built a self-organizing team over six months.

---

## The Scrambled Events

**Instructions:** These 15 events are out of order. Arrange them in the correct chronological sequence, then answer the analysis questions.

---

### Event A
Team retrospective identifies "waiting for PM approval" as their biggest impediment. Average decision wait time is 2.3 days. Team velocity has dropped for three consecutive sprints.

---

### Event B
PM creates and shares a Decision Authority Matrix defining three categories: Team Decides, Team Decides & Informs PM, and PM Approval Required. The matrix gives the team authority over 70% of daily decisions.

---

### Event C
New PM (Jordan) joins the team, inheriting a group that checks every decision with their manager. The previous PM made all significant decisions personally.

---

### Event D
Senior developer makes a technical decision independently for the first time. The decision works well. Jordan publicly recognizes the initiative in the team channel: "Great call on the caching approach. This is exactly the ownership I want to see."

---

### Event E
Jordan analyzes the types of decisions that have been escalating to PM. Categorizes them as: truly need PM input (15%), could be team decisions (60%), and shouldn't even be decisions (25% - things with obvious answers).

---

### Event F
Sprint velocity returns to historical levels. Team survey shows "authority to make decisions" score increased from 2.1 to 3.8. Team reports spending 40% less time waiting for approvals.

---

### Event G
Jordan notices that team members still ask permission for clearly-delegated decisions. Realizes that authority on paper isn't the same as felt authority. Begins coaching team through decisions rather than making them.

---

### Event H
Team holds their first sprint planning without PM task assignments. Team self-assigns work in 20 minutes. Two members volunteer for stretch assignments. Energy in the room is noticeably higher.

---

### Event I
A delegated decision goes wrong—the team chose a vendor that couldn't deliver. Instead of reverting to control, Jordan facilitates a blameless retrospective on what happened and what the team learned.

---

### Event J
Jordan schedules 1:1s with each team member asking: "What decisions do you think you should be able to make that currently require my approval?" Documents the themes.

---

### Event K
Team starts solving problems among themselves before involving Jordan. In one instance, they resolve a cross-team dependency conflict directly with the other team lead—something they would have escalated two months ago.

---

### Event L
Jordan shares the empowerment journey at a PM community meeting. Other PMs are skeptical: "What if they make bad decisions?" Jordan responds: "They will. And they'll learn. My job is to create conditions for smart failure, not prevent all failure."

---

### Event M
Jordan makes a deliberate choice to NOT attend the daily standup for one week. The team runs it themselves successfully. One member comments: "We actually got through it faster."

---

### Event N
Team proposes changing their Definition of Done to include automated testing. Rather than approving or rejecting, Jordan asks questions to help them think through implications, then confirms: "This is your call. You own your quality standards."

---

### Event O
Jordan formally transfers "process improvement" authority to the team. Instead of PM-approved retrospective action items, the team now implements changes directly and reports outcomes.

## Timeline Analysis Questions

### Question 1: Why did Jordan start with analysis (Event E) before creating solutions?

<details>
<summary>Click for Answer</summary>

**Answer:**

Jordan needed to understand the REAL problem before solving it:
- Which decisions actually needed PM involvement?
- Which were being escalated unnecessarily?
- What was the root cause of the dependency?

**Key Finding:** 60% of escalated decisions could be team decisions. This data justified the empowerment approach and helped design the Decision Authority Matrix.

**Principle:** Diagnose before treating. Understand decision patterns before redistributing authority.

</details>

---

### Question 2: What was significant about asking team members directly (Event J)?

<details>
<summary>Click for Answer</summary>

**Answer:**

Jordan asked: "What decisions do you think you should be able to make?"

**This was powerful because:**
- Involved the team in designing their own empowerment
- Identified decisions the team WANTED authority over
- Created buy-in for the new model
- Surfaced decisions Jordan might not have thought to delegate
- Demonstrated respect for the team's judgment

**Principle:** Co-create empowerment. Don't just push authority—ask what authority people want and can handle.

</details>

---

### Question 3: Why was Event G (realizing paper authority isn't enough) important?

<details>
<summary>Click for Answer</summary>

**Answer:**

Jordan created the Decision Authority Matrix, but team members still asked permission. This revealed:

- **Conditioned behavior:** After years of checking everything, habits don't change overnight
- **Fear of failure:** Authority means accountability; some feared making wrong decisions
- **Cultural lag:** The old PM's norms were still in people's heads
- **Trust gap:** Team didn't yet believe the empowerment was real

**Jordan's Response:** Shifted from "giving authority" to "coaching through decisions"—helping people build confidence by working through choices together.

**Principle:** Empowerment requires culture change, not just policy change. Coach people into confidence.

</details>

---

### Question 4: How did Jordan handle the failed decision (Event I)?

<details>
<summary>Click for Answer</summary>

**Answer:**

The team made a bad vendor decision. Jordan's options:
1. ❌ Revoke authority — "See, this is why I need to approve things"
2. ❌ Blame the team — "You should have known better"
3. ✅ Blameless learning — "What happened? What did we learn?"

**Why this matters:**
- If Jordan punished the failure, team would stop taking initiative
- Empowerment REQUIRES permission to fail
- Learning from mistakes builds better judgment than never making them

**Principle:** How you handle failure determines whether empowerment survives. Punish failure = kill empowerment.

</details>

---

### Question 5: What did Event M (PM not attending standup) demonstrate?

<details>
<summary>Click for Answer</summary>

**Answer:**

Jordan deliberately stepped away for a week. Results:
- Team ran standup successfully
- Actually finished faster
- Demonstrated they didn't need PM presence

**This validated:**
- Self-organization was real, not performative
- Team had internalized ownership
- PM presence wasn't necessary for daily function
- Empowerment had become the team's norm

**Principle:** Test empowerment by stepping back. If the team functions well without you, you've succeeded.

</details>

---

### Question 6: What is the significance of the progression from individual empowerment (Event D) to team empowerment (Events N, O)?

<details>
<summary>Click for Answer</summary>

**Answer:**

**Early Phase (Event D):**
- Individual developer makes a decision
- PM recognizes it specifically
- Builds confidence one person at a time

**Later Phase (Events N, O):**
- TEAM proposes Definition of Done changes
- TEAM owns process improvement authority
- Collective ownership, not just individual delegation

**The Progression:**
1. Individual empowerment → builds confidence
2. Success recognition → reinforces behavior
3. Team sees what's possible → culture shifts
4. Team collectively owns decisions → self-organization achieved

**Principle:** Start with individuals, scale to teams. Build momentum through visible wins.

</details>

---

### Question 7: Why did Jordan wait until Event O to formally transfer process improvement authority?

<details>
<summary>Click for Answer</summary>

**Answer:**

Sequence mattered:
1. First, team demonstrated they could make decisions
2. Then, team showed they could learn from failures
3. Then, team proved they could run without PM
4. FINALLY, formal authority transfer

**Why wait?**
- Premature formal authority without demonstrated capability = setup for failure
- Team needed to BUILD to that level of ownership
- Jordan needed evidence it would work
- Formal transfer validated what was already happening

**Principle:** Formal authority follows demonstrated capability. Don't transfer ownership before readiness is proven.

</details>

---

### Question 8: What made Jordan's approach to sharing (Event L) notable?

<details>
<summary>Click for Answer</summary>

**Answer:**

Other PMs asked: "What if they make bad decisions?"

Jordan's response: "They will. And they'll learn. My job is to create conditions for smart failure, not prevent all failure."

**Key Insights:**
- Accepted that failure is part of empowerment
- Reframed PM role: enabler of learning, not preventer of mistakes
- "Smart failure" = bounded risk, learning extracted
- Control doesn't prevent failure—it just centralizes it

**Principle:** Empowerment means accepting that people will make mistakes. Your job is to make those mistakes survivable and educational.
