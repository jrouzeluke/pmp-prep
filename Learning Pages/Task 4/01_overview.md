# Task 4: Empower Team Members and Stakeholders
## OVERVIEW TAB (7 Sections)

---

## Section 1: What This Task Is

**Definition**
"Organize around team strengths, support task accountability, evaluate demonstration of accountability, and determine and bestow levels of decision-making authority."

**Core Principle**
Empowerment is not abdication—it's intentional authority distribution matched to capability. True empowerment gives people both the responsibility AND the authority they need to succeed. Project managers create conditions where team members own outcomes, make decisions within their scope, and grow through progressive responsibility. The goal is self-organizing teams that deliver results without constant PM intervention.

**The Empowerment Equation:**
Empowerment = Authority + Accountability + Autonomy + Support

All four elements must be present. Missing any one creates frustration, failure, or dependency.

## Section 2: ECO Enablers

✓ **Organize around team strengths** — Assign work based on capabilities, preferences, and development goals
✓ **Support task accountability** — Create clear ownership with defined expectations and success criteria
✓ **Evaluate demonstration of accountability** — Assess results, not just effort; verify commitments are met
✓ **Determine and bestow levels of decision-making authority** — Match authority to capability and situation

## Section 3: Key Frameworks

### The Empowerment Triangle

| Element | Definition | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Authority** | Right to make decisions | "You decide the technical approach" |
| **Accountability** | Ownership of outcomes | "You own the delivery date" |
| **Autonomy** | Freedom to choose how | "Implement however works best" |

**Critical Rule:** All three must be given together. Authority without accountability creates chaos. Accountability without authority creates frustration. Autonomy without either creates confusion.

### Delegation Levels (Situational Leadership)

| Level | PM Role | Team Authority | When to Use |
|-------|---------|----------------|-------------|
| **1. Direct (Tell)** | PM decides, directs | Execute only | New/unskilled team, crisis |
| **2. Coach (Sell)** | PM decides, explains why | Input welcomed | Building capability |
| **3. Support (Participate)** | Team decides with PM input | Shared decision | High skill, variable confidence |
| **4. Delegate (Entrust)** | Team decides independently | Full ownership | High skill, high confidence |

### Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RACI)

| Role | Definition | Rule |
|------|------------|------|
| **R**esponsible | Does the work | Can be multiple people |
| **A**ccountable | Ultimate owner, final decision | ONLY ONE per task |
| **C**onsulted | Input before decision | Two-way communication |
| **I**nformed | Notified after decision | One-way communication |

**Exam Alert:** There can only be ONE "A" (Accountable) per task. Multiple "A"s = no accountability.

## Section 4: How To Apply It

### Organizing Around Strengths

**Step 1: Assess Team Strengths**
- Technical skills (what can they do?)
- Soft skills (how do they work?)
- Preferences (what energizes them?)
- Development goals (what do they want to learn?)

**Step 2: Match Work to Strengths**
- Assign critical work to strongest capability
- Pair stretch assignments with support
- Balance utilization with growth opportunities
- Consider motivation, not just skill

**Step 3: Create Complementary Teams**
- Mix skill sets for coverage
- Pair experienced with developing
- Balance personalities and working styles
- Ensure no single points of failure

### Bestowing Decision-Making Authority

**Progressive Delegation Model:**

| Stage | PM Says | Team Does |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| **Investigate** | "Research options and report back" | Gather information only |
| **Recommend** | "Analyze and tell me your recommendation" | Recommend, PM decides |
| **Decide and Inform** | "Decide and tell me what you chose" | Team decides, informs PM |
| **Decide and Act** | "You own this—handle it" | Full autonomy |

**Matching Authority to Situation:**

| Factor | Lower Authority | Higher Authority |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| Risk/Impact | High stakes | Reversible decisions |
| Experience | New to domain | Proven track record |
| Urgency | Time to consult | Rapid response needed |
| Complexity | Cross-functional | Within expertise |

### Supporting Accountability

**Clear Expectations Framework:**
1. **What** — Specific deliverable or outcome
2. **Why** — Purpose and importance
3. **When** — Deadline or cadence
4. **How** (if needed) — Constraints, standards, approach
5. **So What** — Success criteria, how we'll know it's done

**Accountability Support System:**
- Regular check-ins (not check-ups)
- Clear escalation paths when stuck
- Resources and access provided upfront
- Consequences defined (positive and negative)
- Recognition for delivered accountability

## Section 5: Exam Triggers

Watch for these signals that indicate an Empower Team question:

**Keywords:**
- "Team needs authority to decide"
- "Delegation question"
- "Self-organizing team"
- "Accountability issue"
- "Micromanagement" or "too much oversight"
- "Team capable but not trusted"
- "Responsibility without authority"
- "Who should make this decision?"

**Scenario Patterns:**
- Experienced team asking for more autonomy
- PM making decisions team should make
- Team member given task but not resources
- High performer frustrated by oversight
- Agile team not self-organizing
- Blame without empowerment

**Question Stems:**
- "The team is capable but keeps asking for approval. The PM should..."
- "A team member was assigned a task but cannot access needed resources. The PM should..."
- "The Scrum team wants to change their Definition of Done. The PM should..."
- "A senior developer is frustrated that decisions require PM approval. What should the PM do FIRST?"

## Section 6: Quick Scenarios

| Scenario | Result | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| Experienced team asks who should design the architecture | ✅ Right: "You have the expertise—decide as a team and brief me" | Delegate to capable teams |
| New team member unsure how to approach their first task | ✅ Right: "Let me walk you through it step-by-step" | Direct/coach new members before delegating |
| Team member repeatedly asks PM for approval on routine decisions | ✅ Right: "You're empowered to decide these—I trust your judgment" | Break dependency cycles |
| PM assigns task but doesn't provide system access | ❌ Wrong: Responsibility without authority | Match authority to responsibility |
| High-performing team wants to change their process | ✅ Right: "Try it and let me know if you need support" | Self-organizing teams own processes |
| PM delegates then checks every detail | ❌ Wrong: Micromanaging after delegation | Delegate outcomes, not activities |
| Team makes bad decision after being empowered | ❌ Wrong: "I told you to check with me first!" | Don't blame when empowered decisions fail |
| PM holds all decision authority to maintain control | ❌ Wrong: Creates bottleneck and disengagement | PM doesn't need to decide everything |
| Team member succeeds with delegated task | ✅ Right: Recognize and expand their authority | Success enables more delegation |
| Agile team defers to PM on how to do their work | ❌ Wrong: Team should own "how" | PM provides "what/why," team decides "how" |

## Section 7: Common Mistakes

### Wrong Answer Patterns on Exam

| Trap | Why It's Wrong | Better Approach |
|------|----------------|-----------------|
| "Micromanaging experienced teams" | Signals distrust, slows delivery | Delegate outcomes, check results |
| "Delegating to incapable team members" | Setting them up for failure | Match authority to demonstrated capability |
| "Responsibility without authority" | Frustration, learned helplessness | Always pair responsibility with needed authority |
| "Requiring approval for everything" | Creates bottleneck, kills motivation | Define decision rights clearly |
| "Not checking results (abdication)" | Delegation ≠ abandonment | Monitor outcomes, stay available |
| "Blame when empowered decisions fail" | Destroys psychological safety | Coach, don't punish learning |
| "One-size-fits-all delegation" | People have different readiness | Adjust authority level to individual |
| "Assuming team wants full autonomy" | Some prefer guidance | Ask about comfort level |

### The Delegation vs. Abdication Distinction

| Delegation (Good) | Abdication (Bad) |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Clear expectations set | Vague or no expectations |
| Success criteria defined | "Figure it out" |
| Support available | Unavailable when needed |
| Progress monitored | Complete hands-off |
| Accountability maintained | No consequences either way |
| Feedback provided | Silence until failure |

### Special Exam Alert: Agile Context

**Self-Organizing Teams in Agile:**
- Team decides **HOW** to do the work
- Product Owner decides **WHAT** to build
- Scrum Master removes **OBSTACLES**
- Team commits to **THEIR OWN** estimates

**Wrong Answers in Agile:**
- "PM tells team how to build features" → Team decides how
- "PM assigns individual tasks" → Team self-assigns
- "PM estimates on behalf of team" → Team estimates their own work
- "PM approves technical decisions" → Team owns technical approach

## Quick Reference Card

### Empowerment Checklist
□ Clear expectations set (what, why, when)
□ Authority granted to match responsibility
□ Resources and access provided
□ Support available when needed
□ Success criteria defined
□ Accountability for outcomes
□ Recognition for results

### The Four Levels of Authority
1. **Investigate** → Report options
2. **Recommend** → Suggest, PM decides
3. **Decide & Inform** → Team decides, tells PM
4. **Decide & Act** → Full autonomy

### Key Exam Principles
- **Capability determines authority level** — Match delegation to skill
- **All three elements required** — Authority + Accountability + Autonomy
- **Agile teams self-organize** — PM removes obstacles, team decides how
- **Delegation is not abandonment** — Monitor outcomes, stay available
- **Empowerment builds engagement** — Ownership drives motivation
