# Task 4: Empower Team Members and Stakeholders
## PMP APPLICATION TAB (5 Sections)

---

## Section 1: How This Task Is Tested

Empower Team questions test your ability to match authority levels to team capability, create conditions for self-organization, and balance delegation with accountability. These questions appear frequently because empowerment underpins agile and servant leadership—core PMI themes. Expect 3-5 questions directly on this task, with significant overlap in team leadership and stakeholder engagement questions.

### Question Patterns

| Pattern | What They Test | Key Signals in Question |
|---------|----------------|-------------------------|
| **Authority Matching** | Appropriate delegation level | "Experienced team member...", "New to the role...", "Proven track record..." |
| **Self-Organization** | When to let team decide | "Agile team wants to...", "Team asks who should...", "How to implement..." |
| **Accountability Setup** | Creating ownership | "Assign responsibility...", "Ensure delivery...", "Who owns..." |
| **Micromanagement Recognition** | Identifying over-control | "PM reviews every...", "Requires approval for...", "Checks all decisions..." |
| **Empowerment Gaps** | Missing authority/resources | "Cannot access...", "No authority to...", "Waiting for approval..." |
| **Delegation Failures** | Abdication vs delegation | "PM not available...", "No guidance given...", "Left to figure out..." |

### What PMI Expects

- **Trust capable team members** — Don't micromanage experienced professionals
- **Match authority to capability** — New members need direction; veterans need autonomy
- **Provide resources with responsibility** — Authority must match accountability
- **Support self-organizing teams** — PM removes obstacles, team decides approach
- **Monitor outcomes, not activities** — Check results, not every step
- **Enable, don't control** — Servant leadership means serving the team's ability to deliver

### The PMI Mindset for This Task

PMI believes empowerment drives engagement, ownership, and results. The "right" answer almost always involves:
1. Assessing capability before choosing delegation level
2. Providing authority AND resources to match responsibility
3. Trusting the team to make decisions within their expertise
4. Staying available without hovering
5. Recognizing success and coaching through failures

## Section 2: Sample Question 1

### Scenario

A senior software architect on your team has 15 years of experience and consistently delivers high-quality work. Recently, she has become frustrated because every technical decision requires your approval before implementation. She mentions that this slows down the team and makes her feel like she isn't trusted. What should you do?

**Options:**

A) Explain that your approval process ensures quality and protects the project from risks

B) Delegate full decision-making authority for technical architecture decisions to her

C) Create a decision framework that defines which decisions require your approval and which she can make independently

D) Ask her to document her decisions so you can review them after implementation

---

### Correct Answer: C

---

### Analysis

**Why C is correct:**

The key issue is a mismatch between capability and authority. The architect is highly capable (15 years, consistent quality) but has minimal authority (everything requires approval). The solution needs to:
1. Increase her authority appropriately
2. Maintain necessary oversight for high-impact decisions
3. Create clarity for both parties

A decision framework accomplishes all three. It empowers her for routine/moderate decisions while preserving PM involvement for high-risk choices. This respects her expertise while maintaining appropriate governance.

**Why others are wrong:**

| Option | Problem |
|--------|---------|
| A | Ignores legitimate concern; treats capable professional like a novice; will increase frustration and likely lead to departure |
| B | Goes too far in the other direction; some decisions may warrant PM awareness/input; no transition period |
| D | Doesn't address the core issue (slow decisions); post-implementation review doesn't speed up the team |

### Key Principle

**Progressive empowerment with clear boundaries.** Don't swing from micromanagement to abdication. Create a structured approach that matches authority to decision type and builds trust over time.

### Decision Framework Example

| Decision Type | Authority Level | Example |
|--------------|-----------------|---------|
| Routine technical | Architect decides, acts | Library selection, code patterns |
| Moderate impact | Architect decides, informs PM | Database schema changes |
| High impact | Architect recommends, PM approves | Major architecture shifts |
| Strategic | Joint decision | Technology platform changes |

## Section 3: Sample Question 2

### Scenario

You are leading an agile project with a mature, high-performing Scrum team. During sprint planning, the team is discussing how to implement a complex feature. A stakeholder suggests that you, as the project manager, should assign specific tasks to each developer to ensure efficient execution. What should you do?

**Options:**

A) Agree with the stakeholder and assign tasks based on each developer's strengths

B) Thank the stakeholder for their input and explain that the team will self-organize to determine task assignments

C) Ask the team if they would prefer you to assign tasks or if they want to decide themselves

D) Compromise by assigning the most critical tasks while letting the team decide the rest

---

### Correct Answer: B

---

### Analysis

**Why B is correct:**

This is a core agile principle question. In Scrum and agile frameworks:
- The **Product Owner** decides WHAT gets built (prioritizes backlog)
- The **Team** decides HOW to build it (self-organizes, assigns tasks)
- The **Scrum Master/PM** removes OBSTACLES (serves the team)

A mature, high-performing team should absolutely self-organize. The PM assigning tasks undermines team ownership, reduces engagement, and violates agile principles. The correct response thanks the stakeholder (respectful) while educating about agile team dynamics.

**Why others are wrong:**

| Option | Problem |
|--------|---------|
| A | Violates agile self-organization principle; removes team ownership; stakeholder dictating team process |
| C | Abdicates leadership; mature teams don't need to "choose" — self-organization is the expected model |
| D | Partial violation still undermines team; sends mixed message about trust |

### Key Principle

**Protect team self-organization.** The PM's role in agile is to create conditions for success, not to direct how work gets done. Politely but firmly maintain this boundary with stakeholders.

### Agile Empowerment Boundaries

| Role | Decides | Does NOT Decide |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| Product Owner | What to build, priority | How to build, who does what |
| Team | How to build, task distribution | What to build, business priority |
| Scrum Master/PM | How to remove obstacles | How team should work |

## Section 4: Sample Question 3

### Scenario

A team member was assigned responsibility for delivering a critical integration component. However, she does not have access to the partner company's API documentation or the credentials needed to test the integration. She has asked the PM for help twice but hasn't received a response. The deadline is approaching. What should the PM do FIRST?

**Options:**

A) Extend the deadline since the team member was not given the resources needed to complete the task

B) Immediately provide the required access and credentials, and check if other resources are missing

C) Document the issue and escalate to the partner company's project manager

D) Reassign the task to someone who already has the necessary access

---

### Correct Answer: B

---

### Analysis

**Why B is correct:**

This is a classic "responsibility without authority/resources" scenario. The team member was set up for failure:
- Given accountability (deliver the integration)
- NOT given authority/resources (no API docs, no credentials)
- Asked for help (twice!) and was ignored

The PM's FIRST action must be to fix what the PM controls: provide the missing resources immediately. The second part ("check if other resources are missing") shows proactive thinking to prevent recurrence.

**Why others are wrong:**

| Option | Problem |
|--------|---------|
| A | Doesn't solve the problem — just moves the deadline; resources still missing |
| C | Escalating before providing what you can provide; documentation doesn't deliver the component |
| D | Punishes the team member for PM's failure; doesn't address root cause; may not be possible |

### Key Principle

**Responsibility MUST be paired with resources and authority.** When delegation fails, the PM should look inward first. Common setup-for-failure patterns:
- No access/credentials/permissions
- No budget allocated
- No time allocated (still doing other work)
- No stakeholder introduction (authority not communicated)
- No decision rights (must check everything)

### The Empowerment Audit

Before delegating, verify:
- [ ] Access to all required systems
- [ ] Authority to make necessary decisions
- [ ] Budget/resources approved
- [ ] Stakeholders aware of their authority
- [ ] Time allocated (other work reduced)
- [ ] Support available when stuck

## Section 5: Exam Strategy

### Quick Decision Guide

| If You See... | Look For Answer That... |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| Experienced team, PM approving everything | Delegates appropriate authority |
| Agile team, PM assigning tasks | Protects self-organization |
| Team member can't access resources | Provides access/removes obstacle |
| New team member struggling | Provides coaching/direction (not full delegation) |
| Capable team held back | Increases decision authority |
| No accountability structure | Creates clear ownership and expectations |
| PM checking every detail | Recommends outcome-based monitoring |
| Team succeeds with authority | Recognizes and extends empowerment |

### Key Phrase Recognition

**Empowerment-Positive Signals:**
- "Let the team decide"
- "Provide authority to match responsibility"
- "Trust the team's expertise"
- "Enable self-organization"
- "Remove obstacles"
- "Delegate decision rights"

**Empowerment-Negative Signals (Usually Wrong Answers):**
- "PM should decide"
- "Require approval for all decisions"
- "Assign specific tasks" (in agile context)
- "Review before they can proceed"
- "Maintain control"
- "Check every step"

### DO vs. DON'T

| ✅ DO | ❌ DON'T |
|-------|----------|
| Match authority to demonstrated capability | Treat everyone the same regardless of experience |
| Provide resources WITH responsibility | Assign tasks without access/authority |
| Let agile teams self-organize | Assign work to agile team members |
| Define decision boundaries clearly | Leave authority ambiguous |
| Monitor outcomes, stay available | Hover over every activity OR disappear entirely |
| Build trust through progressive delegation | Jump straight to full delegation OR never delegate |
| Coach when empowered decisions fail | Blame or revoke authority on first mistake |
| Recognize success and expand authority | Ignore good performance |

### Common Trap Patterns

**Trap 1: "Protect the project" through over-control**
- Sounds reasonable: "Ensure quality by reviewing..."
- Reality: Capable teams don't need PM review of everything
- Better: Define what actually needs PM input

**Trap 2: "Support the team" by making decisions for them**
- Sounds reasonable: "Help by deciding so team can execute..."
- Reality: Removes ownership and learning
- Better: Coach team to make the decision

**Trap 3: "Be available" by requiring constant check-ins**
- Sounds reasonable: "Stay close to help when needed..."
- Reality: Becomes surveillance, not support
- Better: Schedule touch-points, be responsive between

**Trap 4: "Ensure accountability" through detailed tracking**
- Sounds reasonable: "Track progress to ensure delivery..."
- Reality: Focus on activities vs outcomes
- Better: Clear milestones, verify results

### The Empowerment Test

When evaluating answer choices, ask:
1. Does this INCREASE or DECREASE the team's ability to act?
2. Does this BUILD or DIMINISH trust?
3. Does this CREATE or PREVENT ownership?
4. Does this MATCH authority to capability?

Choose answers that increase capability, build trust, create ownership, and appropriately match authority.
