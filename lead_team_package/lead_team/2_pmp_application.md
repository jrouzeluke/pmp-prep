How This Task Appears on the Exam

The PMP exam tests your ability to select appropriate leadership styles and guide teams through development stages. Questions focus on situational judgment rather than memorization.

Question Patterns

📋 Pattern 1: Team Development Stage Recognition
Format: Scenario describes team behaviors, asks what stage they're in or what PM should do
Key Words: "Team members are competing for influence" = Storming
Example: "Team is arguing about approaches. What should the PM do FIRST?"

🎯 Pattern 2: Leadership Style Selection
Format: Situation given, asks which leadership style is most appropriate
Key Words: "Crisis", "new direction", "high-performing team", "low morale"
Example: "Team is burned out after intense deadline. Best leadership approach?"

⚡ Pattern 3: Servant Leadership Application
Format: PM must choose between controlling and enabling approaches
Key Words: "Remove obstacles", "empower", "support team needs"
Example: "Team blocked by process. What should PM do?"

🔄 Pattern 4: Adapting Leadership Style
Format: Team circumstances change, PM must adjust approach
Key Words: "Team was performing but now...", "new team member joined"
Example: "High performer added to struggling team. How should PM lead?"

Exam Question Analysis

Sample Question 1: Team Development

"Your project team has been working together for 3 weeks. Two senior team members are openly disagreeing about the technical approach. Other team members are choosing sides. Productivity has decreased. What should you do FIRST?"

A) Remove one of the disagreeing members from the project
B) Make the technical decision yourself to end the conflict
C) Facilitate a discussion to help the team work through the disagreement
D) Ignore it and let them work it out themselves

✅ Correct Answer: C
Why: Team is in Storming stage. PM should facilitate conflict resolution (Coaching style), not avoid it (D), force it (B), or overreact (A). Conflict is normal in Storming and needs facilitation.

❌ Why Others Are Wrong:
- A: Overreaction, removes valuable team member, doesn't address root cause
- B: Commanding style inappropriate here, team needs to work through conflict
- D: Avoiding conflict in Storming prolongs the stage and damages team

Sample Question 2: Leadership Style

"Your team has been consistently delivering high-quality work on time for the past 6 months. They self-organize effectively and rarely need your intervention. A new complex feature needs to be implemented. What is the BEST leadership approach?"

A) Provide detailed instructions on how to implement the feature
B) Let the team determine the approach and offer support if needed
C) Work alongside them to set the pace and demonstrate your expertise
D) Hold daily check-ins to monitor their progress closely

✅ Correct Answer: B
Why: High-performing team (Performing stage) needs Delegating leadership style. Trust their capability, provide autonomy, offer support when requested.

❌ Why Others Are Wrong:
- A: Micromanaging a high-performing team (Commanding style inappropriate)
- C: Pacesetting can be demotivating for capable team, implies they need you to lead
- D: Over-monitoring shows lack of trust, inappropriate for Performing stage

Sample Question 3: Servant Leadership

"Your team reports they cannot access the test environment needed to complete their work. The IT department says it will take 2 weeks to provision. What should you do?"

A) Tell the team to work on other tasks while waiting
B) Escalate to your sponsor to expedite the request
C) Have the team create a workaround solution
D) Contact IT immediately to expedite, escalate if necessary

✅ Correct Answer: D
Why: Servant leadership means removing obstacles for the team. PM should act immediately to remove this impediment, escalating if IT cannot expedite.

❌ Why Others Are Wrong:
- A: Accepts the obstacle without trying to remove it (not servant leadership)
- B: Escalating first is unnecessary, try to resolve at appropriate level first
- C: Workarounds may not fully address the need and waste team time

Sample Question 4: Style Adaptation

"Your team was performing well but two key members just left. The remaining team seems uncertain and is asking for more direction. What should you do?"

A) Continue delegating as before since the team was performing well
B) Provide more structure and direction as the team reforms
C) Let the new team dynamics settle naturally
D) Bring in consultants to fill the gaps

✅ Correct Answer: B
Why: Team has regressed from Performing back to Forming due to membership changes. PM must adapt style from Delegating back to Authoritative/Commanding to provide needed structure.

❌ Why Others Are Wrong:
- A: Ignores that team stage changed, inappropriate leadership style now
- C: Team needs active leadership during transition, not passive approach
- D: May be needed eventually but doesn't address immediate leadership need

Common Exam Traps

Trap 1: Servant Leadership ≠ Weak Leadership
Wrong Thinking: "Servant leadership means letting team decide everything"
Right Thinking: "Remove obstacles, provide support, but still provide direction when needed"
Example: Team is blocked → PM actively removes obstacle (not passive)

Trap 2: One Leadership Style for All Situations
Wrong Thinking: "Democratic style is always best because it's collaborative"
Right Thinking: "Match style to situation - crisis needs Commanding, high performers need Delegating"
Example: Crisis occurs → Commanding temporarily appropriate despite being "negative" style

Trap 3: Avoiding Conflict in Storming
Wrong Thinking: "Conflict is bad, should be eliminated immediately"
Right Thinking: "Conflict in Storming is normal and healthy, needs facilitation not elimination"
Example: Team arguing → Facilitate discussion (not force decision or avoid)

Trap 4: Micromanaging = Good Leadership
Wrong Thinking: "PM should make all decisions to ensure quality"
Right Thinking: "Empower team to decide based on their capability level"
Example: Experienced team → Delegate decisions (not control everything)

Trap 5: Ignoring Emotional Needs
Wrong Thinking: "Focus only on tasks and deliverables"
Right Thinking: "Team morale and relationships affect performance"
Example: Burned out team → Affiliative style to rebuild relationships (not more pressure)
