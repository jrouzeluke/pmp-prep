<details>
<summary>Click for Answer</summary>

✅ **Correct Answer: B) Commanding**

**Why Commanding is Right:**
- **True emergency** - Revenue loss, customer impact
- **Immediate action required** - No time for discussion
- **Team waiting for direction** - Need clear orders now
- **Crisis situation** - Commanding's appropriate use case

**What to do:**
"Here's what we're doing: Jordan, investigate database logs. Casey, check API connections. Taylor, prepare customer communication. Morgan, monitor system status. Report back in 15 minutes. Go."

**After crisis passes:**
- Transition to other styles immediately
- Debrief and learn (Coaching)
- Thank and support team (Affiliative)
- Plan prevention (Democratic)

---

**Why Other Styles Are Wrong:**

❌ **A) Democratic** - "What do you think we should do?"
- **Time waste:** Discussion takes time you don't have
- **Appears indecisive:** Team needs confident direction
- **Wrong urgency:** Use when time available
- **Consequence:** Extended outage, more customer impact

❌ **C) Coaching** - "Let's use this to learn about incident response"
- **Wrong priority:** Fix problem first, learn later
- **Appears tone-deaf:** Customers are suffering now
- **Delays resolution:** Teaching takes time
- **Consequence:** Team loses confidence in your judgment

❌ **D) Affiliative** - "How is everyone doing? Are you stressed?"
- **Wrong focus:** People over task inappropriate in crisis
- **Wastes critical time:** Every minute matters
- **Appears disconnected:** Team needs action, not feelings check
- **Consequence:** Crisis worsens while you focus on emotions

**Key Learning:**
Commanding style exists for true emergencies. This is one. Use it decisively, then immediately transition to other styles when crisis passes.

## Situation 2: New Project Kickoff

**Context:**
You're starting a 9-month project with a new team. The organization has struggled with similar projects in the past. Team members are uncertain about the approach and concerned about feasibility. Stakeholders are skeptical. You need to build confidence and alignment.

**Which leadership style should you use PRIMARILY?**

A) Commanding - Tell them exactly what to do
B) Authoritative - Provide compelling vision and direction
C) Pacesetting - Show them how it's done
D) Democratic - Let team decide the approach

<details>
<summary>Click for Answer</summary>

✅ **Correct Answer: B) Authoritative**

**Why Authoritative is Right:**
- **New direction needed** - Team needs vision
- **Uncertainty present** - Clear direction builds confidence
- **Skepticism exists** - Compelling vision overcomes doubt
- **Alignment required** - Vision creates shared understanding
- **Most positive climate impact** - Motivates and inspires

**What to do:**
"Here's where we're going and why this matters. [Articulate compelling vision]. Here's how we'll succeed where others haven't. [Explain strategy]. I need you to bring your expertise on HOW we get there. [Empower within vision]."

**Why it works:**
- Provides clarity (removes uncertainty)
- Inspires confidence (addresses skepticism)
- Builds alignment (everyone understands destination)
- Allows autonomy on execution (team determines "how")

---

**Why Other Styles Are Wrong:**

❌ **A) Commanding** - "Here's exactly what each of you will do"
- **Too directive:** Stifles initiative and creativity
- **Doesn't inspire:** Orders don't create commitment
- **Limits ownership:** Team becomes order-followers
- **Consequence:** Dependent team, low engagement

❌ **C) Pacesetting** - "Watch me, do it this way"
- **Creates pressure:** Not appropriate for project start
- **May overwhelm:** Team not ready for high pace
- **Wrong message:** "Keep up or fail" instead of "we'll succeed together"
- **Consequence:** Anxiety instead of confidence

❌ **D) Democratic** - "Let's all discuss what we should do"
- **Premature:** Team doesn't have enough context yet
- **Appears uncertain:** Looks like PM doesn't know direction
- **Time-consuming:** Discussion without foundation ineffective
- **Consequence:** Confusion, no alignment, wasted time

**Key Learning:**
Authoritative style is best when team needs direction and clarity. Provide compelling vision, explain why it matters, then empower team to execute.

## Situation 3: Team Burned Out After Crunch

**Context:**
Your team just completed a grueling 3-month period with 60-hour weeks, weekend work, and high stress. The deadline was met successfully. However, team members look exhausted, two called in sick today, and one person snapped at a colleague over a minor issue. Morale is clearly low.

**Which leadership style should you use NOW?**

A) Pacesetting - Push through to next milestone
B) Affiliative - Focus on relationships and recovery
C) Commanding - Enforce reasonable work hours
D) Democratic - Ask team what they want to do

<details>
<summary>Click for Answer</summary>

✅ **Correct Answer: B) Affiliative**

**Why Affiliative is Right:**
- **Relationships strained** - Stress damaged team bonds
- **Morale low** - Need emotional support
- **People exhausted** - Physical and emotional recovery needed
- **Irritability evident** - Team needs care, not more pressure
- **Appropriate priority** - People before next task

**What to do:**
- Acknowledge the sacrifice explicitly
- Provide real recovery time (not just "normal" hours)
- Schedule team celebration
- Individual check-ins on well-being
- Show genuine care and appreciation
- Flexible schedules for personal needs

**Example approach:**
"You accomplished something remarkable under extreme pressure. Before anything else, we need recovery time. Take the next week to rest, reconnect with family, and recharge. I've arranged [celebration]. Your well-being is the priority right now."

---

**Why Other Styles Are Wrong:**

❌ **A) Pacesetting** - "Great work! Now let's hit the next milestone with the same intensity"
- **Ignores exhaustion:** Team is depleted
- **Risks burnout:** Continuing intensity causes collapse
- **Shows no care:** Message is "you're just resources"
- **Consequence:** Resignations, long-term damage, project failure

❌ **C) Commanding** - "Everyone must work only 40 hours this week"
- **Misses the point:** They need time off, not just normal hours
- **Still task-focused:** Doesn't address emotional needs
- **Mechanical solution:** Treats symptom not cause
- **Consequence:** Physical rest but relationships still damaged

❌ **D) Democratic** - "What do you all want to do next?"
- **Still working:** Implies no break, just different work
- **Puts burden on them:** They shouldn't have to decide about their recovery
- **Lacks leadership:** PM should recognize need and act
- **Consequence:** Team resents having to advocate for basic care

**Key Learning:**
After intense periods, teams need relationship repair and genuine recovery. Affiliative style prioritizes people, rebuilds trust, and prevents burnout from becoming permanent.

## Situation 4: Complex Technical Decision

**Context:**
Your team needs to choose between three database architectures for the new system. Each approach has trade-offs. Your team has deep technical expertise - two members worked on similar systems at previous companies. Implementation will require strong team buy-in. You have 2 weeks to decide.

**Which leadership style should you use?**

A) Commanding - Make the decision yourself
B) Democratic - Facilitate team discussion and decision
C) Authoritative - Provide vision then decide
D) Coaching - Teach them decision-making process

<details>
<summary>Click for Answer</summary>

✅ **Correct Answer: B) Democratic**

**Why Democratic is Right:**
- **Team has expertise** - They know more than you
- **Complex decision** - Multiple perspectives valuable
- **Buy-in critical** - Team will implement, need ownership
- **Time available** - 2 weeks allows for discussion
- **Engagement builder** - Participation increases commitment

**What to do:**
"This is a critical technical decision. You have the expertise we need. Let's use structured discussion:
- Each approach presented with pros/cons
- Evaluate against criteria (performance, maintainability, scalability, cost)
- Team discussion and recommendation
- We'll decide together or I'll decide based on your input with clear rationale"

**Why it works:**
- Leverages team's expertise
- Creates ownership of decision
- Better decision quality (multiple perspectives)
- Builds engagement and commitment

---

**Why Other Styles Are Wrong:**

❌ **A) Commanding** - "I've decided we're using PostgreSQL"
- **Wastes expertise:** Team knows more, you decide anyway
- **No buy-in:** They'll resent imposed decision
- **Poorer decision:** You don't have their knowledge
- **Consequence:** Implementation issues, resistance, suboptimal choice

❌ **C) Authoritative** - "Here's the vision... therefore we'll use MongoDB"
- **Vision doesn't determine technical choice:** Architecture needs technical analysis
- **Appears disconnected:** Vision alone insufficient for complex technical decision
- **Underutilizes team:** Their expertise ignored
- **Consequence:** Technically suboptimal decision made for wrong reasons

❌ **D) Coaching** - "Let me teach you how to evaluate databases"
- **Wrong priority:** They already know how, don't need teaching
- **Condescending:** Implies they lack capability they have
- **Wastes time:** 2 weeks used for lessons instead of decision
- **Consequence:** Team resentment, delayed decision

**Key Learning:**
Democratic style shines when team has expertise and you need buy-in. Facilitate their knowledge, don't override it.

## Situation 5: Junior Developer Wants to Grow

**Context:**
A junior developer (Robin) asks to meet with you. They express interest in learning about architecture and design patterns. They're motivated and doing good work but lack experience. You have time to invest in their development. The project timeline is not urgent.

**Which leadership style should you use with Robin?**

A) Commanding - Assign them architecture work
B) Coaching - Develop their capabilities over time
C) Democratic - Ask what they want to learn
D) Affiliative - Build personal relationship

<details>
<summary>Click for Answer</summary>

✅ **Correct Answer: B) Coaching**

**Why Coaching is Right:**
- **Development opportunity** - Robin wants to grow
- **Motivated learner** - Receptive to coaching
- **Time available** - No urgency constraints
- **Long-term focus** - Building capability for future
- **Appropriate relationship** - PM developing team member

**What to do:**
- Regular development conversations (weekly or bi-weekly)
- Assign stretch assignments with support
- Provide specific feedback on their work
- Share your thinking process on architecture decisions
- Create learning opportunities
- Gradually increase complexity
- Celebrate progress

**Example approach:**
"I'd love to support your growth in architecture. Let's start by having you shadow me on design discussions. Then I'll give you a smaller component to design with my feedback. Over time, we'll increase the complexity. I'll meet with you weekly to discuss what you're learning."

---

**Why Other Styles Are Wrong:**

❌ **A) Commanding** - "Here, design this system component"
- **No support:** Throws them in without preparation
- **Setup for failure:** Too much too soon
- **Not development:** Assignment without growth framework
- **Consequence:** Poor results, discouraged learner

❌ **C) Democratic** - "What do you want to learn? How should we approach this?"
- **Too open-ended:** Junior needs more structure and guidance
- **Puts burden on them:** They don't know what they don't know
- **Inefficient:** PM should guide learning path
- **Consequence:** Unfocused development, time wasted

❌ **D) Affiliative** - "Let's get coffee and talk about life"
- **Wrong focus:** They asked for skill development, not friendship
- **Avoids commitment:** Doesn't address development request
- **Misses opportunity:** Could build capability but focuses on relationship only
- **Consequence:** Robin feels request dismissed, no development

**Key Learning:**
Coaching style is for development over time. Requires ongoing investment, structured growth, and genuine commitment to building capability.

## Situation 6: Sprint to Demo in 4 Days

**Context:**
You have a critical product demo to the board of directors in 4 days. The features work but need polish. Your team is highly capable and has delivered under pressure before. They're motivated and understand the importance. You need to demonstrate commitment and urgency without micromanaging.

**Which leadership style should you use?**

A) Commanding - Direct every action
B) Pacesetting - Work alongside them, set the pace
C) Democratic - Discuss approach with team
D) Authoritative - Provide vision and let them execute

<details>
<summary>Click for Answer</summary>

✅ **Correct Answer: B) Pacesetting**

**Why Pacesetting is Right:**
- **Short-term push** - 4 days is temporary intensity
- **Capable team** - They can meet high standards
- **Clear deadline** - Board demo is concrete goal
- **Lead by example** - Your commitment inspires theirs
- **Temporary intensity** - Won't last long enough to burn out

**What to do:**
- Work alongside team during critical periods
- Demonstrate commitment through your actions
- Set high standards by example
- Roll up sleeves and contribute directly
- Be visible and present
- Share the burden

**Example approach:**
"This demo is critical. I'm going to be working alongside you these 4 days. I'll take on [specific tasks], you handle your areas. We'll do brief check-ins morning and evening. Let's show the board what we can do."

**Critical caveat:**
This is ONLY for 4 days. After demo, immediately:
- Return to normal pace
- Provide recovery time
- Don't make this the new normal
- Thank team for extra effort

---

**Why Other Styles Are Wrong:**

❌ **A) Commanding** - "Do exactly what I say, work until midnight"
- **Micromanagement:** Capable team doesn't need detailed orders
- **Demotivating:** Treats them as order-followers
- **Inefficient:** Your control slows them down
- **Consequence:** Resentment, reduced initiative

❌ **C) Democratic** - "Let's discuss the best approach for the demo"
- **Wrong timing:** 4 days is too tight for extensive discussion
- **Already clear:** They know what needs doing
- **Wastes time:** Discussion doesn't add value here
- **Consequence:** Lost time, appears indecisive

❌ **D) Authoritative** - "Here's the vision for the demo" then step back
- **Not enough presence:** Short deadline needs hands-on engagement
- **Misses opportunity:** Your participation inspires and supports
- **Too distant:** Team wants to see commitment, not just words
- **Consequence:** Team feels alone in the pressure

**Key Learning:**
Pacesetting is powerful for short-term pushes with capable teams. But ONLY short-term. After demo, immediately return to sustainable pace and provide recovery.

## Situation 7: Two Stakeholders Want Different Things

**Context:**
The VP of Sales wants features that drive revenue. The VP of Operations wants features that reduce costs. Both are equally powerful stakeholders. Their priorities conflict. Your project can't do both in the current timeline. You need to make a decision that someone will disagree with.

**Which leadership style should you use?**

A) Democratic - Facilitate discussion between VPs
B) Commanding - Make the decision yourself immediately
C) Affiliative - Try to make everyone happy
D) Authoritative - Decide based on strategic vision

<details>
<summary>Click for Answer</summary>

✅ **Correct Answer: A) Democratic (in this case, facilitated stakeholder discussion)**

**Why Democratic is Right:**
- **Both perspectives valid** - Need to understand each
- **Political situation** - Can't just pick one
- **Need buy-in** - Loser must still support project
- **Complex trade-offs** - Discussion reveals best path
- **Facilitation needed** - PM guides to resolution

**What to do:**
"I'm going to bring you both together to discuss priorities. We'll:
- Each present business case for your priorities
- Evaluate against strategic objectives
- Look at phasing options
- Reach agreement on approach
- If no agreement, I'll decide based on discussion with clear rationale both can accept"

**Why it works:**
- Both stakeholders feel heard
- Decision transparent and criteria-based
- Loser understands why
- PM facilitates, doesn't arbitrarily choose
- Better decision from multiple perspectives

---

**Why Other Styles Are Wrong:**

❌ **B) Commanding** - "I've decided we're doing Sales features"
- **Creates enemy:** Operations VP now opposes project
- **Appears arbitrary:** No visible decision process
- **Loses political support:** May cause project cancellation
- **Consequence:** Political damage, project risk

❌ **C) Affiliative** - "Let's find a way to make everyone happy"
- **Unrealistic:** Can't actually deliver both in timeline
- **Delays decision:** Avoiding conflict doesn't resolve it
- **Appears weak:** PM not willing to make tough call
- **Consequence:** Scope creep trying to please everyone, project fails

❌ **D) Authoritative** - "Based on our strategic vision, Sales features align better"
- **Better than Commanding but still unilateral:** Doesn't facilitate discussion
- **May be right decision but wrong process:** Creates resentment
- **Misses insights:** VPs might find creative solution together
- **Consequence:** Correct decision but damaged relationships

**Key Learning:**
When powerful stakeholders conflict, facilitate their discussion before deciding. Democratic process creates buy-in even from whoever doesn't "win."

## Situation 8: Team Member Crying at Desk

**Context:**
You notice one of your team members (Alex) is crying quietly at their desk. You've worked together for 3 months and have a good relationship. Other team members are noticing and looking concerned. The situation is clearly personal, not work-related.

**Which leadership style should you use FIRST?**

A) Commanding - Tell them to take the rest of the day off
B) Affiliative - Show empathy and offer support
C) Democratic - Ask team what we should do
D) Pacesetting - Demonstrate emotional control

<details>
<summary>Click for Answer</summary>

✅ **Correct Answer: B) Affiliative**

**Why Affiliative is Right:**
- **Emotional situation** - Person needs empathy first
- **People before tasks** - This is when relationships matter most
- **Show you care** - Builds trust and psychological safety
- **Appropriate humanity** - Leaders acknowledge team members are human
- **Right priority** - Personal crisis needs personal response

**What to do:**
1. Approach privately and quietly
2. "Alex, I can see you're upset. Can we talk privately?"
3. Move to private space (conference room, outside)
4. Listen with empathy
5. Ask "What do you need right now?"
6. Offer practical support based on their needs
7. Give them options (go home, take break, work from quiet space)
8. Check in later

**Example:**
"Alex, I can see something's wrong. Let's step outside for a minute. [In private] I'm here if you want to talk, or I can just listen, or we can just sit quietly. What would help?"

---

**Why Other Styles Are Wrong:**

❌ **A) Commanding** - "Go home. Take the rest of the day."
- **Makes decision for them:** Removes their agency
- **May not be what they need:** Maybe they want to stay and work
- **Skips empathy:** Goes straight to directive action
- **Consequence:** Person feels pushed out, not supported

❌ **C) Democratic** - "Team, Alex is crying. What should we do?"
- **Violates privacy:** Discusses personal situation publicly
- **Inappropriate involvement:** Team shouldn't decide Alex's needs
- **Abdicates leadership:** PM should handle, not delegate
- **Consequence:** Alex humiliated, trust destroyed

❌ **D) Pacesetting** - "Let's stay focused everyone. Alex will be fine."
- **Ignores humanity:** Pretends people aren't emotional beings
- **No support offered:** Alex left alone in crisis
- **Damages culture:** Message is "don't show emotion here"
- **Consequence:** Psychological safety destroyed, people hide struggles

**Key Learning:**
When team members face personal crises, lead with empathy. Affiliative style prioritizes the human being over the work. This builds long-term trust and loyalty.

## Situation 9: Experienced Team Doubts Your Decision

**Context:**
You've made a strategic decision about the project approach. Your team of senior developers questions it in a meeting. They have valid concerns and deep technical expertise. They're not being disrespectful, but they genuinely believe you're wrong. The decision isn't yet implemented.

**Which leadership style should you use?**

A) Commanding - Assert your authority
B) Democratic - Reopen discussion with team
C) Authoritative - Re-explain your reasoning
D) Affiliative - Smooth over the disagreement

<details>
<summary>Click for Answer</summary>

✅ **Correct Answer: B) Democratic**

**Why Democratic is Right:**
- **Team has expertise** - Should leverage their knowledge
- **Valid concerns raised** - Worth reconsidering
- **Not yet implemented** - Still time to adjust
- **Respectful disagreement** - Healthy challenge, not rebellion
- **Better decision possible** - Their input might improve choice

**What to do:**
"You raise good points. Let's take 30 minutes right now to discuss this thoroughly. I want to understand your concerns and technical perspective. I made this decision based on [rationale], but I'm open to being convinced otherwise if there's a better approach."

Then:
- Listen genuinely to their concerns
- Ask clarifying questions
- Evaluate whether you were wrong or they're missing context
- Either adjust your decision or explain why you're maintaining it with fuller rationale
- Get their commitment forward either way

---

**Why Other Styles Are Wrong:**

❌ **A) Commanding** - "I've made the decision. We're moving forward."
- **Wastes expertise:** They know things you don't
- **Damages trust:** "My authority" over "best decision"
- **Reduces future input:** Team learns not to challenge
- **Consequence:** Poor decisions go unchallenged, team disengagement

❌ **C) Authoritative** - "Let me explain my vision again..."
- **Assumes they didn't understand:** Condescending
- **Doesn't address concerns:** Just repeats original reasoning
- **Misses their input:** Vision doesn't override technical reality
- **Consequence:** Team feels unheard, commitment reduced

❌ **D) Affiliative** - "I value our relationship. Let's not let this divide us."
- **Avoids the issue:** Doesn't address actual concern
- **Relationship over decision quality:** Wrong priority here
- **Appears weak:** Can't defend or reconsider decision
- **Consequence:** Decision stands but doubts remain, implementation halfhearted

**Key Learning:**
When experienced team questions your decision respectfully, reopen the discussion. Either learn something or help them understand your reasoning more fully. Democratic style builds better decisions and stronger teams.

## Situation 10: Post-Project Lessons Learned

**Context:**
Your project just completed successfully. You're conducting a retrospective with the team to capture lessons learned. You want to identify what went well, what could improve, and what the organization should learn. This will inform future projects.

**Which leadership style should you use?**

A) Commanding - Tell them what you observed
B) Authoritative - Provide your vision of what mattered
C) Democratic - Facilitate team discussion and insights
D) Coaching - Help them learn from experience

<details>
<summary>Click for Answer</summary>

✅ **Correct Answer: C) Democratic (with D) Coaching as secondary)**

**Why Democratic is Primary:**
- **Team has the experience** - They lived it, they know best
- **Multiple perspectives valuable** - Each person saw different things
- **Shared learning** - Everyone benefits from discussion
- **Buy-in on improvements** - They own the lessons
- **Organizational learning** - Broader benefit from collaborative insights

**What to do:**
Facilitate structured discussion:
- "What went well?" (everyone contributes)
- "What could we improve?" (honest discussion)
- "What did we learn?" (capture insights)
- "What should we do differently next time?" (actionable recommendations)
- "What should the organization learn?" (broader impact)

**Your role:**
- Facilitate, don't dominate
- Draw out quiet voices
- Probe for deeper insights
- Capture comprehensively
- Synthesize themes

**Coaching Element (Secondary):**
"What did this teach you about [skill area]?"
"How will you apply this learning to your next project?"
Help them extract personal development lessons.

---

**Why Other Styles Are Wrong:**

❌ **A) Commanding** - "Here's what I observed about the project..."
- **One perspective only:** Misses team's insights
- **No collaboration:** Your view imposed as truth
- **Reduces learning:** Team doesn't process their experience
- **Consequence:** Shallow lessons, no team ownership

❌ **B) Authoritative** - "Here's my vision of what this project taught us..."
- **Too PM-centric:** Team's experience more valuable
- **Misses nuance:** Each person learned different things
- **Reduces engagement:** Team becomes passive listeners
- **Consequence:** Important insights missed, limited organizational learning

**Note:** Democratic is primary, but Coaching can be layered in to help individuals extract personal development lessons alongside the team learning.

**Key Learning:**
Retrospectives and lessons learned sessions benefit from Democratic style. Facilitate team discussion to capture collective wisdom, not just your perspective.
