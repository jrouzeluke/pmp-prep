Diagnose Team Development Stages from Real Project Situations

Welcome to Stage Detective! In this activity, you'll analyze 10 realistic project situations and diagnose which of Tuckman's five team development stages each team is experiencing. This mirrors the critical PM skill of reading team dynamics and adapting your leadership approach accordingly.

---

## How to Use Stage Detective

1. **Read each situation carefully** - Look for behavioral clues and patterns
2. **Identify key indicators** - What specific behaviors reveal the stage?
3. **Diagnose the stage** - Forming/Storming/Norming/Performing/Adjourning
4. **Review the analysis** - Understand why and what leadership is needed
5. **Track your score** - Aim for 9+ correct (90%)

**Time Estimate:** 30-40 minutes for all 10 situations

---

## The Five Stages (Quick Reference)

**🌱 Forming:** New team, polite, uncertain, dependent on PM, many questions about roles/process

**⚡ Storming:** Conflict, power struggles, challenging authority, competition, energy to disagreement

**🤝 Norming:** Cooperation, "we" language, processes working, team identity forming, mutual support

**🚀 Performing:** High autonomy, self-organizing, consistent excellence, minimal PM intervention

**👋 Adjourning:** Project ending, reflective, emotional about closure, transition planning

---

## Situation 1: The Monday Morning Standup

### Context

You're observing your team's Monday morning standup, 7 weeks into the project.

**What You Notice:**

**Team Behaviors:**
- Jordan: "We knocked out that API integration Friday. Really proud of how we worked together on it."
- Alex: "Yeah, and I appreciate how you helped me debug that connection issue."
- Casey jumps in: "Since we finished early, I already started exploratory testing on it over the weekend."
- Morgan: "Oh nice! Can you share your test scenarios? I'll add to them."
- Taylor: "Our velocity is really consistent now. We're hitting our targets."
- Robin: "I noticed we're all using the same code review checklist now without being reminded."

**Communication Patterns:**
- People finish each other's sentences occasionally
- Everyone seems comfortable speaking
- Use "we" and "our" frequently
- Volunteering to help each other
- No one defensive when issues raised

**PM Observation:**
- You mostly just listen
- Team runs the meeting themselves
- They've established a smooth rhythm
- Conflicts resolved quickly between members
- People smile and joke with each other

### Your Diagnosis

**What stage is this team in?**

A) Forming - Still getting to know each other
B) Storming - Working through disagreements  
C) Norming - Cooperation and shared norms established
D) Performing - Peak performance and autonomy
E) Adjourning - Winding down the project

## Why Norming is Correct

**Key Indicators Present:**

**1. "We" Language Throughout**
- "We knocked out..." 
- "Our velocity..."
- "We're hitting our targets"
- Sign of team identity forming

**2. Mutual Support and Cooperation**
- Jordan helped Alex with debugging
- Casey sharing test scenarios
- Morgan offering to add to them
- Helping without being asked

**3. Processes Working Smoothly**
- "Consistent velocity"
- "Same code review checklist without being reminded"
- Established rhythm
- Team runs meeting themselves

**4. Comfortable Communication**
- Everyone speaks freely
- Finishing each other's sentences
- No defensiveness
- Joking and smiling

**5. PM Role Appropriate**
- Mostly observing
- Team self-managing day-to-day
- PM doesn't need to direct

**6. Recent Progress Evident**
- "7 weeks into project" - enough time to progress from earlier stages
- Processes now established
- Team cohesion visible

---

## Why Other Stages Are Wrong

❌ **A) Forming**
**Missing indicators:**
- No uncertainty or questions about roles
- Not tentative or polite (they're comfortable)
- No heavy PM direction needed
- Team clearly knows how to work together

**If this were Forming you'd see:**
- "So who's responsible for...?"
- Lots of questions to PM
- Politeness masking uncertainty
- People not volunteering freely

---

❌ **B) Storming**
**Missing indicators:**
- No conflict or power struggles
- No challenging of authority
- No competition or coalitions
- Energy goes to work, not disagreement

**If this were Storming you'd see:**
- Arguments or tension
- "I think we should..." vs "No, we need to..."
- Defensive reactions
- PM mediating conflicts

---

❌ **D) Performing**
**Close but not quite:**
- Team is doing WELL but not yet at peak autonomy
- PM still somewhat involved in standup
- Good performance but not the sustained excellence of Performing
- Haven't yet demonstrated ability to handle major challenges independently

**Key Differences:**
- **Norming:** Processes working, cooperation established, good performance
- **Performing:** Exceptional autonomy, sustained excellence, team handles anything

**Signs of Performing (not present here):**
- Team making strategic decisions without PM
- Anticipating and preventing problems
- Coaching new members
- Innovation and continuous improvement beyond processes

**This team is in healthy Norming, possibly progressing toward Performing**

---

❌ **E) Adjourning**
**Missing indicators:**
- No mention of project ending
- No reflection on accomplishments
- No transition discussions
- No emotional processing of closure

**If this were Adjourning you'd see:**
- "Can't believe we're almost done"
- Discussion of next assignments
- Nostalgia about the journey
- Knowledge transfer activities

---

## What This Team Needs (Leadership Approach)

**Appropriate Style: Democratic**

**Why:**
- Team ready for participation in decisions
- Capable of good input
- Processes established as foundation
- Building toward more autonomy

**What PM Should Do:**
- Continue stepping back strategically
- Involve team in decisions
- Support their established processes
- Recognize and reinforce cooperation
- Don't disrupt what's working
- Watch for readiness to progress to Performing

**What PM Should NOT Do:**
- Revert to directive leadership (would stifle development)
- Introduce unnecessary changes (would disrupt norms)
- Micromanage (team has earned trust)
- Take over the standup (they're running it well)

---

## Timeline Context

**Typical Norming Timeline:**
- Usually emerges 4-8 weeks into project
- After working through Storming conflicts
- Can be sustained for months with maintenance
- May progress to Performing with continued growth

**This Team at 7 Weeks:**
- Right on track for Norming
- Likely went through Storming weeks 3-5
- Now stabilized and cooperating
- Good trajectory toward Performing

---

## Key Learning Points

**Norming Recognition:**
✓ "We" language is hallmark indicator
✓ Cooperation without being forced
✓ Processes running smoothly
✓ Mutual support evident
✓ Team identity formed
✓ Comfortable communication

**Common Mistake:**
Many people confuse Norming and Performing. Remember:
- **Norming** = Working well together, processes established
- **Performing** = Sustained excellence, high autonomy, exceptional capability

**Not Quite There Yet:**
This team is doing well but hasn't demonstrated the sustained exceptional performance and autonomy that defines Performing stage.

## Situation 2: The Email from Frustrated PM

### Context

You're coaching a new PM (Sam) on another project. Sam sends you this email:

**Email:**
```
I don't know what to do with this team. Every decision takes FOREVER because 
everyone has an opinion. 

Yesterday we spent 45 minutes arguing about whether to use REST or GraphQL 
for the API. Maria and Chris were basically yelling at each other. Three 
other team members just sat there looking uncomfortable. 

This morning, Kyle challenged my timeline in front of the whole team, saying 
"That's impossible." Then Dana backed him up.

The team is supposed to be experts but they can't agree on anything. Maria 
and Chris won't even sit next to each other in meetings anymore. I've noticed 
little groups forming - Maria/Keisha vs Chris/Kyle.

I'm about to just make all the decisions myself because they clearly can't 
handle it. We're 3 weeks in and we're getting NOWHERE.

Help?
Sam
```

### Your Diagnosis

**What stage is Sam's team in?**

A) Forming - Still figuring out dynamics
B) Storming - Conflict and power struggles
C) Norming - Establishing cooperation
D) Performing - High performance
E) Adjourning - Project winding down

<details>
<summary>Click for Answer & Analysis</summary>

✅ **Correct Answer: B) Storming**

---

## Why Storming is Correct

**Key Indicators Present:**

**1. Open Conflict**
- "Basically yelling at each other"
- Arguments taking long time (45 min on API decision)
- Maria and Chris won't sit together
- Clear interpersonal tension

**2. Challenging Authority**
- Kyle challenged timeline "in front of whole team"
- Dana backed him up
- Testing PM's authority publicly
- Typical Storming behavior

**3. Coalitions Forming**
- "Maria/Keisha vs Chris/Kyle"
- Subgroups with competing perspectives
- Not working as unified team
- Power struggle dynamics

**4. Competitive Rather Than Collaborative**
- "Everyone has an opinion" (competing, not collaborating)
- Can't reach agreement
- Proving who's right vs. what's best for project
- Individual positions, not team solutions

**5. Some Team Members Withdrawing**
- "Three others just sat there looking uncomfortable"
- Not everyone engaged in conflict
- Some avoiding the storm
- Classic pattern - some fight, some flee

**6. Timeline and Productivity Issues**
- "We're getting NOWHERE"
- 3 weeks in with little progress
- Energy going to conflict, not work
- Typical Storming productivity drop

**7. PM Frustration and Confusion**
- "I don't know what to do"
- Considering forcing decisions (wrong response)
- Feeling overwhelmed
- Not recognizing normal stage

---

## Why Other Stages Are Wrong

❌ **A) Forming**
**Wrong because:**
- Too much conflict (Forming is polite)
- People expressing opinions strongly (Forming is tentative)
- 3 weeks in usually past Forming
- Authority being challenged (Forming is dependent)

**Forming looks like:**
- Polite uncertainty
- Many questions
- Dependent on PM
- No conflict yet

---

❌ **C) Norming**
**Wrong because:**
- Active conflict (Norming has cooperation)
- Coalitions forming (Norming has team unity)
- Can't agree (Norming has shared processes)
- No "we" language (Norming uses collective identity)

**Norming looks like:**
- Cooperation established
- Mutual support
- Agreement on processes
- Team identity

---

❌ **D) Performing**
**Obviously wrong:**
- Major conflicts
- No productivity
- PM overwhelmed
- Zero autonomy
- Nowhere near peak performance

---

❌ **E) Adjourning**
**Wrong because:**
- Project just started (3 weeks in)
- No indication of ending
- Conflict is about work, not closure
- No transition planning

---

## What Sam Should Do (Coaching Advice)

**DO NOT:**
❌ Make all decisions unilaterally ("I'm about to just make all decisions myself")
- Would suppress conflict, not resolve it
- Prolongs Storming stage
- Team doesn't learn to work together
- Creates dependency

**INSTEAD:**

**1. Recognize This is Normal**
"Sam, your team is in Storming stage. This is completely normal and actually necessary for team development. Every high-performing team goes through this."

**2. Use Coaching Style**
- **Don't avoid the conflict** (would prolong it)
- **Don't force decisions** (would suppress, not resolve)
- **Facilitate constructive resolution**

**3. For the API Decision (REST vs GraphQL):**
"Bring Maria and Chris back together with structured discussion:
- Each presents their approach (20 min uninterrupted)
- Evaluate against criteria: performance needs, team skills, timeline, maintenance
- Team discussion using criteria
- Reach decision together or you decide based on criteria with clear rationale"

**4. For the Timeline Challenge:**
"Kyle challenging your timeline is actually good - he has expertise. Instead of being defensive:
- 'Kyle, you said it's impossible. Help me understand why.'
- Get specifics about concerns
- Adjust timeline if he's right, or explain constraints if you can't
- Convert challenge into collaboration"

**5. For the Coalitions:**
"Break up the Maria/Keisha vs Chris/Kyle dynamic:
- Mix them in pair/small group work
- Don't let them self-select into same groups
- Find common ground between factions
- Facilitate whole-team discussions on shared goals"

**6. Reinforce Shared Vision:**
"Remind them regularly why the project matters and what you're trying to achieve together. Connect their daily conflicts back to shared goals."

**7. Set Ground Rules for Disagreement:**
"Create team agreement on how to handle disagreements:
- Respectful discussion
- Focus on project needs, not personal preferences
- Time-boxed debates
- Structured decision process"

---

## Timeline Expectations

**Typical Storming Timeline:**
- Usually emerges weeks 2-4 after Forming
- Can last 3-8 weeks
- Longer if not facilitated well
- Shorter with good PM leadership

**Sam's Team at 3 Weeks:**
- Right on schedule
- Just entering Storming
- Will get worse before it gets better
- PM's response determines how long it lasts

**If Sam Forces Decisions:**
- Conflict goes underground
- May last months
- Team never reaches Norming/Performing

**If Sam Facilitates Well:**
- Work through it in 3-4 weeks
- Emerge stronger as team
- Progress to Norming

---

## Key Learning Points

**Storming Recognition:**
✓ Open conflict and arguments
✓ Challenging PM authority
✓ Coalitions and subgroups
✓ Competition over collaboration
✓ Productivity drops
✓ PM feels frustrated

**Why Storming Happens:**
- Initial politeness (Forming) wears off
- Different working styles clash
- Power and influence being negotiated
- Reality of project pressure hits
- Natural stage of development

**Critical Understanding:**
**Storming is NECESSARY, not a problem to eliminate.**
- Teams that skip or suppress Storming never reach peak performance
- Working through conflict builds trust and capability
- PM's job is to facilitate, not suppress or force

**New PMs Often:**
- Panic and try to force harmony
- Take challenges personally
- Revert to authoritarian control
- All of which prolong Storming

**Experienced PMs:**
- Recognize it as normal stage
- Facilitate constructively
- Don't take it personally
- Help team work through it

## Situation 3: The Zoom Call Observation

### Context

You join your distributed team's daily standup via Zoom, 2 days into the project.

**What You Observe:**

**Visual:**
- 8 participants, most cameras on
- Everyone's video backgrounds are generic/professional
- People sitting up straight, professional demeanor
- A few people have notebooks, taking detailed notes

**Communication:**
- Each person waits to be called on before speaking
- "Thanks for that update, Jordan. Casey, you're next."
- Updates are formal: "Yesterday I completed X, today I will do Y, no blockers."
- No one interrupts or asks questions during others' updates
- One person asks: "Sarah, how often will we have these standups?"
- Another asks: "Who should I contact if I have questions about the requirements?"

**After the standup:**
- Two people message you privately with similar questions
- "What's the escalation process if I'm blocked?"
- "Am I supposed to attend the weekly status meeting or just you?"
- No sidebar conversations in chat
- Everyone leaves immediately when meeting ends

**Your sense:**
- Meeting feels slightly stiff
- People seem engaged but reserved
- No jokes or casual conversation
- Everyone very polite

### Your Diagnosis

**What stage is this team in?**

A) Forming - New team getting oriented
B) Storming - Conflict brewing
C) Norming - Establishing patterns
D) Performing - Operating smoothly
E) Adjourning - Project ending

<details>
<summary>Click for Answer & Analysis</summary>

✅ **Correct Answer: A) Forming**

---

## Why Forming is Correct

---

## Why Other Stages Are Wrong

❌ **B) Storming**
**Missing indicators:**
- No conflict or disagreement
- No challenging of authority
- No tension or coalitions
- Too polite (Storming is direct/confrontational)
- Too early (usually needs 2-4 weeks before Storming)

**If this were Storming you'd see:**
- Disagreements emerging
- Less politeness
- Challenging suggestions
- Visible tension

---

❌ **C) Norming**
**Missing indicators:**
- No established patterns yet (they're asking about patterns)
- No team identity or "we" language
- No comfortable interaction
- No mutual support evident
- Still very formal

**If this were Norming you'd see:**
- Established processes (not asking about them)
- "We" language
- Casual comfort
- Helping each other
- Team running standup themselves

---

❌ **D) Performing**
**Obviously wrong:**
- Day 2 of project (far too early)
- Highly dependent on PM
- No autonomy
- Basic questions still being asked
- Formal and stiff interaction

**Performing requires:**
- Months of working together typically
- High trust and autonomy
- Established excellence
- Self-organization

---

❌ **E) Adjourning**
**Wrong because:**
- Project just started (day 2)
- No indication of ending
- Forward-looking questions
- No closure activities

---

## What This Team Needs (Leadership Approach)

**Appropriate Style: Authoritative/Commanding (Directive)**

**Why:**
- Forming teams need structure
- Questions indicate need for clarity
- Can't self-organize yet
- Require confident direction

**What PM Should Do Immediately:**

**1. Provide Structure**
- Create and share RACI matrix
- Define meeting schedule and attendance expectations
- Document escalation process
- Clarify decision-making authority
- Establish communication protocols

**2. Answer All Questions Proactively**
Don't wait for questions - address:
- "Standups are daily at 9am, everyone attends"
- "For requirements questions, contact Morgan first, escalate to me if needed"
- "Weekly status meeting: I attend, you don't need to"
- "If you're blocked, raise in standup or Slack me immediately"

**3. Facilitate Relationship Building**
- "Let's take 2 minutes at start of tomorrow's standup for personal intros"
- "Share one thing about yourself non-work related"
- Create Slack channel for casual conversation
- Schedule virtual coffee chat or team building

**4. Set Ground Rules Together**
- Facilitate discussion about team norms
- "What ground rules would help us work well together?"
- Document and share
- Get commitment

**5. Build Psychological Safety**
- "Questions are welcome - I'd rather answer now than have confusion"
- "Make mistakes visible - we learn together"
- Model vulnerability

**6. Be Highly Visible and Available**
- Respond quickly to questions
- Check in with team members
- Be present and engaged
- Show you're invested

---

## What Will Happen Next

**Natural Progression:**

**Week 1-2 (Forming):**
- Continue this polite orientation phase
- Team learns processes and each other
- Many questions
- Low productivity (learning overhead)

**Week 3-5 (Likely Storming):**
- Politeness will wear off
- Disagreements will emerge
- Some will challenge approaches
- Energy will go to conflict
- This is normal and necessary

**Week 6-8 (Hopefully Norming):**
- If Storming handled well
- Cooperation emerges
- Processes smooth out
- Team identity forms

**Beyond Week 8 (Possibly Performing):**
- If foundations solid
- Sustained excellence
- High autonomy
- Minimal PM intervention

---

## Virtual Team Considerations

**Additional Forming Challenges for Distributed Teams:**

**Harder to Build Relationships:**
- No hallway conversations
- No lunch together
- Less informal bonding
- Generic backgrounds = less personal connection

**PM Must Compensate:**
- More intentional relationship building
- Create virtual spaces for casual interaction
- Encourage personal sharing
- Video-on norm helpful

**Communication Gaps:**
- Can't read body language as easily
- Side conversations harder
- Easier to disengage
- Need explicit norms

**For This Team:**
"Let's establish some virtual team norms:
- Cameras on when possible
- Personalize your backgrounds if comfortable
- Stay on a few minutes after standup for chat
- Use reactions/emojis in chat
- Create #random channel for non-work talk"

---

## Key Learning Points

**Forming Recognition:**
✓ Very early in project (days/weeks)
✓ Polite, formal, reserved behavior
✓ Many questions about structure/process
✓ Dependent on PM for direction
✓ Limited informal connection
✓ Taking notes, trying to learn
✓ Uncertainty evident

**Common Mistake:**
New PMs sometimes expect teams to self-organize from day 1. This team's behavior is completely normal and healthy for Forming stage.

**Not a Problem:**
- Formal communication (will loosen)
- Lots of questions (shows engagement)
- Reserved behavior (trust takes time)
- Lack of comfort (comes with time)

**PM's Job in Forming:**
- Provide structure immediately
- Answer questions patiently
- Facilitate connections
- Be directive and confident
- Set foundation for success

**Timeline Reality:**
Don't rush Forming. Teams need this orientation period. Typically 1-4 weeks depending on:
- Team size
- Complexity
- Prior relationships
- PM's effectiveness

</details>

## Situation 4: The Sprint Retrospective

### Context

You're facilitating a sprint retrospective for your team, 5 months into an 8-month project.

**Team Feedback:**

**What Went Well:**
- "We delivered everything we committed to - again" - Jordan
- "The architecture decisions we made in March are really paying off now" - Alex
- "When that prod issue happened Tuesday, we handled it without even involving Sarah" - Casey
- "I love that we can just solve problems without a bunch of meetings" - Morgan
- "Robin got up to speed so fast - we barely noticed when she joined last month" - Taylor

**What Could Be Better:**
- "Documentation still behind - I'll take that on" - Alex (volunteering)
- "We could optimize the build process more" - Jordan (already has ideas)
- "Would like to try mob programming on the complex features" - Casey (suggesting innovation)

**Discussion:**
- Team finishes each other's sentences
- Someone mentions a problem, three people jump in with solutions
- Robin (newest member) contributes ideas freely
- Team makes decisions during retro without checking with you
- You mostly take notes and listen
- They decide on action items without your input
- Lots of laughter and inside jokes
- When you ask "What do you need from me?" they pause...
  - "Just keep getting us budget approvals and dealing with that difficult stakeholder"
  - "Maybe shield us from that reorganization chaos in the rest of the company"

**After the Meeting:**
- Team stays after to keep talking
- They're planning to grab lunch together
- Someone mentions weekend plans and others chime in
- You notice their personal Slack channel is very active

### Your Diagnosis

**What stage is this team in?**

A) Forming - Building relationships
B) Storming - Working through conflict
C) Norming - Establishing cooperation  
D) Performing - Peak performance and autonomy
E) Adjourning - Preparing for closure

<details>
<summary>Click for Answer & Analysis</summary>

✅ **Correct Answer: D) Performing**

---

## Why Performing is Correct

**Key Indicators Present:**

**1. Sustained Excellence**
- "Delivered everything we committed to - again"
- Consistent high performance over time
- Not a one-time success, sustained pattern
- Quality standards maintained

**2. High Autonomy**
- "Handled prod issue without involving Sarah"
- "Solve problems without a bunch of meetings"
- Make decisions during retro without PM
- Don't need PM for day-to-day work

**3. Self-Organization**
- Team volunteers for work (Alex on documentation)
- Propose improvements (build optimization, mob programming)
- Make decisions collectively
- Own their processes

**4. Proactive Problem-Solving**
- Anticipate problems
- Fix things before escalation
- Jordan already has optimization ideas
- Continuous improvement mindset

**5. PM Role Appropriate**
- You "mostly take notes and listen"
- They ask you to handle strategic obstacles only
- "Shield us from reorganization chaos"
- "Get us budget approvals"
- PM focused on external barriers, not team management

**6. Seamless Integration of New Members**
- Robin joined last month
- "Barely noticed" (no regression)
- Contributing freely already
- Team onboarded her effectively

**7. Strong Team Bond**
- Inside jokes
- Finish each other's sentences
- Stay after to socialize
- Weekend plans discussion
- Active personal Slack channel
- Deep trust and connection

**8. Innovation Focus**
- Suggesting mob programming (experimentation)
- Optimizing build process
- Looking beyond just "getting work done"
- Continuous improvement culture

**9. Collective Intelligence**
- "Someone mentions problem, three people jump with solutions"
- Collaborative problem-solving
- Multiple perspectives integrated quickly
- High collaboration efficiency

**10. Long-Term Success**
- 5 months in (enough time to develop)
- "Architecture decisions from March paying off" (seeing long-term results)
- Sustained trajectory

---

## Why Other Stages Are Wrong

❌ **A) Forming**
**Obviously wrong:**
- 5 months in (way past Forming)
- High autonomy (Forming is dependent)
- Inside jokes (Forming is formal)
- Robin integrated easily (Forming struggles with new people)

---

❌ **B) Storming**
**Missing indicators:**
- Zero conflict
- High cooperation
- No power struggles
- No challenging authority
- Unified team identity

---

❌ **C) Norming**
**This is the tricky one - why NOT Norming?**

**Key Differences:**

| Norming | Performing |
|---------|-----------|
| Cooperation established | Exceptional autonomy |
| Processes working | Process optimization |
| Good performance | Sustained excellence |
| Team makes some decisions | Team makes most decisions |
| "We" language | Deep collaboration |
| PM still somewhat involved | PM focuses on external obstacles |
| Building toward autonomy | Full autonomy achieved |

**Specific Evidence This Is Beyond Norming:**

**Autonomy Level:**
- Norming: Team can handle day-to-day with some PM guidance
- This team: Handled production issue without PM involvement

**Performance:**
- Norming: Meeting expectations consistently
- This team: "Delivered everything - again" (exceeding, sustained)

**Innovation:**
- Norming: Following established processes
- This team: Optimizing and experimenting (mob programming)

**PM Role:**
- Norming: PM still facilitating and guiding
- This team: PM taking notes, focused only on external barriers

**New Member Integration:**
- Norming: Would cause some adjustment
- This team: "Barely noticed" Robin joining (seamless)

**Critical Distinction:**
Norming teams are doing WELL. Performing teams are doing EXCEPTIONALLY WELL with HIGH AUTONOMY. This team crossed that threshold.

---

❌ **E) Adjourning**
**Wrong because:**
- Not preparing for closure
- 3 months left in project
- Forward-looking (optimizations, innovations)
- No transition discussions
- No emotional processing of ending

**Adjourning would include:**
- "Can't believe we only have 3 months left"
- Discussion of next assignments
- Knowledge transfer planning
- Reflective nostalgia

---

## What This Team Needs (Leadership Approach)

**Appropriate Style: Delegating**

**Why:**
- Team has earned complete trust
- Demonstrated sustained capability
- Self-managing effectively
- Need PM for strategic support only

**What PM Should Do:**

**1. Get Out of Their Way**
- Let them own day-to-day work
- Don't intervene unless asked
- Trust their decisions
- Resist urge to "help" when not needed

**2. Focus on Strategic Obstacles**
They told you what they need:
- Budget approvals (organizational barriers)
- Difficult stakeholder management (external issues)
- Shield from reorganization chaos (protect their focus)

**3. Remove External Barriers**
- Navigate organizational politics
- Secure resources
- Manage stakeholder expectations
- Protect team from disruption

**4. Recognize and Celebrate**
- Ensure team gets organizational credit
- Share their success stories
- Advocate for them with leadership
- Public recognition

**5. Challenge Appropriately**
- Provide stretch goals
- Support their innovations (mob programming experiment)
- Encourage optimization (build process)
- Keep them growing

**6. Don't Disrupt**
- Don't introduce unnecessary changes
- Don't revert to directive leadership
- Don't take over during challenges
- Trust them through difficulties

**7. Prepare for Transition**
Start thinking about:
- Project closure in 3 months
- Knowledge transfer
- Team member next assignments
- Adjourning stage approaching

---

## What Could Go Wrong

**Risks with Performing Teams:**

**1. Complacency**
- Team becomes too comfortable
- Stops innovating
- "Good enough" becomes standard
- **Prevention:** Continue challenging with stretch goals

**2. Burnout**
- High performance is demanding
- May be working unsustainable hours
- **Prevention:** Monitor workload, encourage breaks

**3. Taking for Granted**
- PM neglects recognition
- Team feels undervalued
- Good people start looking elsewhere
- **Prevention:** Continue appreciation and development

**4. Disruption**
- Organizational changes force team breakup
- New members added unnecessarily
- Processes changed by mandate
- **Prevention:** Protect team from unnecessary disruption

**5. PM Micromanaging**
- PM reverts to directive style during challenge
- Destroys trust
- Performance drops
- **Prevention:** Continue trusting through difficulties

---

## Timeline Context

**Typical Performing Timeline:**

**How Long to Reach:**
- Usually 3-6 months for new teams
- Requires successful progression through earlier stages
- Depends on PM effectiveness and team capability

**This Team:**
- 5 months in = reasonable timeframe
- Likely progressed:
  - Month 1: Forming
  - Months 2-3: Storming  
  - Months 3-4: Norming
  - Month 5+: Performing

**How Long It Lasts:**
- Can be sustained indefinitely with proper support
- Requires ongoing maintenance
- Stable team composition helps
- Good leadership essential

**What's Coming:**
- 3 months until project end
- Will enter Adjourning stage
- Need to prepare for closure
- Maintain performance through end

---

## Key Learning Points

**Performing Recognition:**
✓ Sustained excellence over time
✓ High autonomy, minimal PM intervention
✓ Self-organization and proactive problem-solving
✓ PM focuses on external barriers only
✓ Innovation and continuous improvement
✓ Seamless integration of new members
✓ Deep trust and strong bonds
✓ Collective intelligence in action

**Critical Distinction:**
- **Norming = Working well together**
- **Performing = Working exceptionally well with high autonomy**

Many people struggle to distinguish these. Key question:
"Could this team handle most challenges without PM involvement?"
- Norming: Some challenges, with PM guidance
- Performing: Most challenges, minimal PM involvement

**Rare Achievement:**
Not all teams reach Performing. Requires:
- Effective progression through earlier stages
- Good leadership throughout
- Stable team composition
- Ongoing support and development

**This Team:**
Example of Performing done right. They're:
- Delivering consistently
- Self-managing effectively
- Innovating continuously
- Strongly bonded
- Properly supported by PM

**Most Important:**
When you have a Performing team, protect it. These are rare and valuable. Don't disrupt unnecessarily, don't micromanage, and continue recognizing their excellence.

## Situation 5: The Final Week Email

### Context

You receive this email from your team member, Alex, on Monday of the project's final week.

**Email:**
```
Subject: Next Week and Beyond

Hey Sarah,

I can't believe this is our last week working together. This project has been 
the highlight of my career so far.

I wanted to thank you before things get hectic with wrap-up activities. You 
gave us space to figure things out (even when we were arguing in March - 
sorry about that!), but you were always there when we needed you.

I'm excited about my new assignment, but I'm also really sad. I know Morgan, 
Jordan, and I are all on the same next project, but we won't have Casey, 
Taylor, or Robin. And honestly, even with three of us together, it won't be 
the same. This team was special.

Do you think we could do a team reunion in a few months? Maybe grab dinner? 
I'd hate to lose touch with everyone.

I'm also realizing I don't know what happens to all our work. Who takes over 
the system? Will they know how to maintain it? We put so much into building 
this right.

Anyway, sorry for the rambling emotional email. See you at this afternoon's 
lessons learned session. I've been thinking a lot about what made this team 
work.

Thanks for everything,
Alex

P.S. I've been updating my resume and I'd love to use you as a reference if 
that's okay. Also, if you hear of any senior developer roles in the company, 
please keep me in mind.
```

### Your Diagnosis

**What stage is this team in?**

---

## Why Other Stages Are Wrong

❌ **A) Forming**
**Obviously wrong:**
- Project ending, not starting
- Deep relationships, not new ones
- Reflection backward, not orientation forward
- Career transitions, not role questions

---

❌ **B) Storming**
**Wrong because:**
- No current conflict
- Apologizing for PAST conflict (March)
- Positive reflection on team
- Gratitude, not frustration
- Strong bonds, not power struggles

**The March reference:**
Alex mentions arguing in March but isn't currently in Storming. Looking back with perspective and gratitude shows they moved beyond it.

---

❌ **C) Norming**
**Wrong because:**
- Project ending (Norming is mid-project)
- Focused on closure, not cooperation
- Emotional about ending, not about processes working
- Transition planning, not norm establishing

---

❌ **D) Performing**
**Wrong because:**
- Not focused on current work
- Focused on ending and transition
- Emotional processing dominant
- Knowledge transfer concerns
- Career next steps

**Note:** This team WAS Performing earlier. Now they're in Adjourning. Teams progress through stages as project evolves.

---

## What This Tells You

**Emotional Indicators:**

**1. Loss and Sadness**
- "Really sad"
- "Won't be the same"
- "Hate to lose touch"
- Normal grief about ending

**2. Gratitude**
- "Thank you"
- "Highlight of my career"
- "Thanks for everything"
- Appreciating the experience

**3. Anxiety About Future**
- Excited but uncertain
- Questions about next steps
- Career concerns
- Transition stress

**4. Nostalgia**
- Looking back fondly
- "This team was special"
- Remembering the journey
- Positive memories

**5. Desire to Preserve**
- "Reunion in a few months"
- Keep relationships
- Don't want to lose connections
- Value what was built

**Mix of Emotions is Normal:**
- Happy about accomplishment
- Sad about ending
- Excited about future
- Anxious about change
- Grateful for experience

This emotional complexity is classic Adjourning stage.

## What Alex Needs (and the Team)

**Appropriate Style: Coaching/Affiliative**

**Why:**
- Emotional support needed (Affiliative)
- Reflection and learning focus (Coaching)
- Transition support (Both)
- Closure and celebration (Affiliative)

**How to Respond to Alex's Email:**

**Immediate Response (within hours):**
```
Subject: RE: Next Week and Beyond

Alex,

Thank you for this thoughtful email. It means a lot.

YES to the reunion dinner - I'll organize it. Let's plan for 6-8 weeks out 
so everyone can join. I don't want us to lose touch either.

For your specific questions:
- Reference: Absolutely, I'd be honored. I'll send you some talking points 
  about your contributions here.
- Senior dev roles: I'll keep my eyes open and connect you.
- System handoff: Operations team takes over July 1. We're doing knowledge 
  transfer sessions Wed-Fri this week. Your participation will help ensure 
  they're ready.

You're right - this team WAS special. The arguing in March? That's when we 
became a real team. Working through that conflict made us stronger.

I'm proud of you and excited for your next role. But I'm also sad. These 
endings are hard, especially when the team was this good.

See you at the lessons learned session. Your reflections will be valuable.

Sarah

P.S. Three of you staying together is a gift to that next project. Take what 
you learned here and build another great team.
```

**Why This Response Works:**
- Acknowledges emotions (Affiliative)
- Answers practical questions (supportive)
- Agrees to reunion (preserves relationships)
- Validates the experience ("team WAS special")
- Reframes March conflict positively (learning)
- Offers career support (development)
- Shows PM is sad too (authentic emotion)
- Forward-looking while honoring past

---

## Timeline Context

**Typical Adjourning:**

**When It Starts:**
- Usually last 2-4 weeks of project
- Sometimes earlier if known end date
- Emotions intensify as date nears

**This Team:**
- Last week = intense Adjourning
- Likely started processing closure 2-3 weeks ago
- Final week is most emotional

**Duration:**
- 2-4 weeks for most teams
- Longer for very close teams
- Shorter for teams eager to move on

**After Project Ends:**
- Emotional processing continues
- First few days of new assignment may be hard
- Comparisons to old team common
- Eventually adjust to new normal

---

## Key Learning Points

**Adjourning Recognition:**
✓ Project ending / final weeks
✓ Emotional processing (sadness, gratitude, nostalgia)
✓ Reflection on journey
✓ Transition concerns and planning
✓ Desire to preserve relationships
✓ Knowledge transfer focus
✓ Career next steps
✓ Lessons learned activities

**Emotional Complexity:**
Adjourning is emotionally richest stage:
- Multiple competing emotions
- Mix of positive and negative
- Grief and excitement coexisting
- Anxiety and gratitude together

**High-Performing Teams Feel It More:**
- Stronger bonds = more loss
- Greater success = more nostalgia
- Better experience = harder ending
- Alex's depth of emotion reflects team quality

**PM's Role:**
- Facilitate proper closure
- Support emotional processing
- Ensure knowledge transfer
- Celebrate accomplishments
- Maintain relationships
- Support transitions

**Critical Understanding:**
How teams end matters. Good closure:
- Honors what was built
- Preserves relationships
- Captures learning
- Supports transitions
- Leaves people wanting to work together again

Poor closure:
- Damages relationships
- Wastes organizational learning
- Leaves people bitter
- Makes them hesitant about future teams

**This Team:**
Alex's email shows healthy Adjourning. They:
- Feel safe expressing emotions
- Value the experience
- Want to stay connected
- Care about their work continuing
- Processing thoughtfully

**Sarah's opportunity:**
Lead this team through excellent closure. They deserve it.

## Situations 6-10: Shorter Scenarios

The remaining 5 situations are presented more briefly. Apply your diagnostic skills.

---

### Situation 6: The Slack Exchange

**3 weeks into project:**

```
[10:15] Jordan: @team heads up, I'm blocked on the database schema. 
Need the requirements finalized before I can proceed.

[10:16] Morgan: Oh sorry, I thought Alex was doing requirements?

[10:17] Alex: No, I'm on the API design. I thought you were doing requirements.

[10:17] Morgan: That's not what I understood from kickoff...

[10:18] Casey: Wait, who's the tech lead on this? Jordan or Alex?

[10:19] Jordan: I don't know, honestly. Sarah, can you clarify?

[10:20] Taylor: Also, what's the approval process for design decisions? 
Do we need sign-off or just inform?

[10:21] Sarah: [Joins conversation] Let me address all of this. Give me 
30 minutes to document roles and processes. Sorry for the confusion.

[10:22] Alex: Thanks. We need that clarity.
```

**What stage?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

✅ **Forming**

**Why:**
- Confusion about roles (who does what)
- Questions about processes (approval process)
- Looking to PM for clarity
- 3 weeks in (Forming timeframe)
- Basic structure missing
- No conflict, just confusion

**PM Failed to Provide:**
Clear RACI matrix and decision-making process in Forming stage. This confusion is PM's responsibility to fix.
</details>

---

### Situation 7: The Overheard Conversation

**You hear this in the hallway after a team meeting:**

"I cannot work with Chris anymore. Every time I suggest something, he shoots it down. He thinks he knows everything."

"I know, Maria. He's so arrogant. And did you see how Sarah just lets him dominate the discussion?"

"Seriously. I'm about ready to request a transfer off this project."

"Same. Want to grab lunch and vent?"

**What stage?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

✅ **Storming**

**Why:**
- Personal conflict ("cannot work with")
- Name-calling ("arrogant")
- Coalitions forming (venting together)
- Considering leaving team
- Frustration with PM's handling
- Interpersonal tension high

**PM Issue:**
Not facilitating the conflict. "Lets him dominate" = PM avoiding responsibility to manage Storming dynamics.
</details>

---

### Situation 8: The Meeting You Missed

**You were out sick yesterday. Team member reports:**

"Yesterday's planning meeting went great. Since you were out, we just ran it ourselves. Jordan facilitated, we went through all the stories, estimated as a team, and committed to the sprint goals. Alex documented everything and sent you the notes.

Oh, and we ran into that architectural question you and I discussed last week. The team talked through the trade-offs and made a decision. It's in the notes. Let us know if you see any issues with our approach, but we're pretty confident.

Hope you're feeling better!"

**What stage?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

✅ **Performing**

**Why:**
- Team operated without PM seamlessly
- Self-organized the meeting
- Made architectural decision autonomously
- Confident in their choices
- Documented for PM (respectful but independent)
- "Let us know if you see issues" (not asking permission, informing)

**Key Indicator:**
PM absence didn't slow them down. Performing teams can function without PM for operational work.
</details>

---

### Situation 9: The Retrospective Notes

**From retrospective notes, 6 weeks in:**

**What Went Well:**
- "We're starting to find our rhythm" - Jordan
- "I like how we handled that disagreement last week about testing approach" - Casey
- "Team is helping each other more" - Morgan
- "Our standups feel productive now" - Alex

**What Could Improve:**
- "Still figuring out code review process" - Taylor
- "Would like clearer decision rights" - Jordan
- "Need better way to share knowledge" - Robin

**Action Items:**
- Team to draft code review guidelines (owned by Alex and Casey)
- Sarah to clarify decision authority matrix
- Try pairing/mob programming next sprint

**What stage?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

✅ **Norming**

**Why:**
- "Finding our rhythm" = processes establishing
- Handled disagreement constructively = moved past Storming
- Helping each other = cooperation
- Still refining processes = Norming characteristic
- Team taking ownership (drafting guidelines)
- Not yet Performing (still figuring things out, PM still needed for clarity)

**Transition Phase:**
Late Storming / Early Norming. Team progressing well.
</details>

---

### Situation 10: The Project Update

**Your update to sponsor, 10 weeks in:**

"The project is in trouble. We're 3 weeks behind schedule. The team can't seem to agree on anything. I've tried everything:
- Made decisions myself → they resist implementation
- Let them decide → endless discussions with no resolution
- Brought in technical experts → team argues with them too

Maria and Chris are barely speaking. Every technical decision turns into a debate. I'm spending all my time mediating conflicts instead of managing the project.

I'm considering requesting different team members. These people just can't work together."

**What stage?**
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

✅ **Storming** (and PM is handling it poorly)

**Why:**
- Can't agree on anything = conflict
- Technical decisions turn into debates = power struggles
- Maria and Chris barely speaking = interpersonal tension
- Behind schedule = Storming productivity drop
- PM spending time on conflict = typical Storming

**PM Problems:**
- Tried forcing (made decisions) = wrong
- Tried avoiding (endless discussions) = wrong
- Wants to replace team = overreaction
- Doesn't recognize normal stage = inexperienced

**What PM Should Do:**
- Recognize Storming as normal and necessary
- Facilitate conflict constructively (Coaching style)
- Don't force, don't avoid
- Help team work through it
- Be patient - this passes

**Critical Learning:**
Wanting to replace team members during Storming is common new PM mistake. The people aren't the problem - the stage is. Almost any team goes through this.
</details>

- **Remember:** Forming = questions, Norming = established norms

**If you confused Storming and Performing:**
- **Review:** Conflict indicators vs. excellence indicators
- **Remember:** Storming = energy to conflict, Performing = energy to excellence

**If you confused Norming and Performing:**
- **Key distinction:** Cooperation (Norming) vs. exceptional autonomy (Performing)
