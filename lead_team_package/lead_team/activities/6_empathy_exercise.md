[END CURSOR FLAG]

Experience Team Leadership from Your Team Members' Point of View

Welcome to Team Member Perspectives! In this activity, you'll step into the shoes of different team members experiencing various team development stages and leadership styles. This builds the empathy and understanding essential for effective situational leadership.

---

## Why This Matters

**Most PM activities show the PM's perspective:**
- What should I do as PM?
- What leadership style should I use?
- How do I diagnose the stage?

**This activity flips the script:**
- What does it FEEL like to be on this team?
- What do team members actually need?
- How does my leadership style impact people?
- What's the emotional experience of each stage?

**Great leaders understand:**
- Team members are complete humans with emotions, needs, and perspectives
- The same leadership approach affects different people differently
- What team members experience determines how they perform
- Empathy is the foundation of effective leadership

---

## How to Use This Activity

1. **Read each scenario completely** - Get into character
2. **Experience their perspective** - What would YOU feel in this situation?
3. **Answer reflection questions** - Think deeply about their needs
4. **Review the analysis** - Understand the leadership implications
5. **Apply to your work** - Remember these perspectives with your real team

**Time Estimate:** 45-60 minutes for all scenarios

## Part 1: The Journey Through Stages

### Scenario 1A: Alex's First Week (Forming)

**YOU ARE: Alex, UX Designer**

**Your Background:**
- 5 years of design experience
- New to this company (3 months)
- This is your first project at the company
- You're confident in your skills but unfamiliar with this team's processes
- You tend to be introverted and thoughtful

---

**DAY 1 - KICKOFF MEETING:**

The PM (Sarah) welcomes everyone and starts presenting the project charter. You're taking detailed notes. There are 7 people in the room - you recognize two from orientation but haven't actually worked with them.

Sarah talks about goals, timeline, and deliverables. It all sounds good, but you have questions:
- When do I present designs to the team?
- Who has final approval on UX decisions?
- What design system or style guide should I use?
- Who are the other designers I'll work with? (Or am I the only one?)

You raise your hand tentatively. Sarah calls on you.

**You:** "Hi, um, could you clarify the design approval process?"

**Sarah:** "Great question, Alex! Let's park that and I'll send everyone a process document after this meeting."

She moves on. You write "APPROVAL PROCESS - WAIT FOR EMAIL" in your notes.

The meeting ends. Everyone files out politely. You're not sure if you should approach Sarah now or wait for the email. Two people are already talking to her. You decide to head back to your desk.

---

**YOUR INTERNAL MONOLOGUE AS YOU SIT AT YOUR DESK:**

*"Okay, so... what am I supposed to do now? Sarah said she'd send a document, but when? Today? Next week? Should I start on designs? But I don't know what approval process to follow or who my stakeholders are.*

*I don't want to bother Sarah - she's the PM, she's busy. And everyone else seems to know what they're doing. If I ask too many questions, they'll think I'm not capable.*

*Maybe I should just wait for that email. But what if it doesn't come today? Do I just... sit here? I feel kind of useless right now.*

*I wish I knew who the other designers were. Or if there even ARE other designers. Am I supposed to do all the UX work myself? That wasn't clear.*

*Everyone was nice, but I don't really know anyone. I noticed Morgan smiled at me - maybe I could ask them? But I don't want to seem needy on my first day.*

*I'm probably overthinking this. Everyone's first project at a new company is awkward, right? I just need to give it time."*

---

**YOUR EVENING AT HOME:**

You tell your partner about your first day.

**Partner:** "How was the new project kickoff?"

**You:** "It was... fine. The PM seems nice. The project sounds interesting."

**Partner:** "But...?"

**You:** "I don't know. I just feel really uncertain about what I'm supposed to be doing. I have questions but I don't want to be annoying. And I don't really know anyone on the team yet."

**Partner:** "I'm sure it'll get better once you start working together."

**You:** "Yeah, probably. I just wish there was more structure. Like, a clear role definition or process guide or something. I feel like I'm supposed to just figure it out."

---

### Reflection Questions

**1. What stage is this team in, from Alex's perspective?**

**2. What emotions is Alex experiencing?**
   - List at least 5 specific feelings

**3. What does Alex need most from Sarah right now?**
   - What would make Alex feel more confident and capable?

**4. What assumptions is Alex making?**
   - Are they accurate? How might they be wrong?

**5. If you were Sarah, what would you do in the next 24 hours?**
   - Be specific about actions

**6. How might Alex's introversion affect their experience?**
   - How would an extrovert experience this differently?

## Analysis of Alex's Experience

### Emotional State

**Alex is feeling:**
1. **Uncertain** - Doesn't know processes, roles, expectations
2. **Anxious** - Worried about appearing incompetent
3. **Isolated** - Doesn't know team members, sitting alone
4. **Inadequate** - "Everyone else seems to know what they're doing"
5. **Hesitant** - Tentative hand-raising, not wanting to bother Sarah
6. **Impatient** - Wants to start work but doesn't know how
7. **Self-doubting** - "Am I overthinking this?"
8. **Hopeful** - "It'll get better," trying to stay positive

**This is classic Forming stage emotional experience.**

---

### What Alex Needs

**Immediate Needs (within 24 hours):**

1. **Clear role definition**
   - Detailed job description for this project
   - Who they work with
   - Who approves their work
   - What they're responsible for

2. **Process documentation**
   - Design approval process
   - Stakeholder communication protocols
   - Design system/style guide location
   - Review and feedback cadence

3. **Initial tasks**
   - Specific first assignments
   - Clear deliverables with deadlines
   - Success criteria

4. **Human connection**
   - Introduction to key collaborators
   - 1-on-1 with Sarah
   - Team coffee chat or social opportunity

5. **Permission to ask questions**
   - Explicit statement: "Questions are welcome"
   - Multiple channels to ask (email, Slack, 1-on-1)
   - Reassurance that questions are normal

---

### What Sarah Should Do

**Within 2 hours of kickoff meeting:**

**Email to Alex (and team):**
```
Subject: Process Documents and Getting Started

Team,

Thanks for the great kickoff meeting! I know several of you had questions 
about processes and roles.

ATTACHED:
- RACI Matrix (who does what)
- Decision-making framework
- Communication protocols
- Design approval process (Alex, this answers your question)

ALEX - SPECIFIC FOR YOU:
You're our lead UX designer (only designer on the team). You'll work closely 
with Jordan (dev lead) and Casey (product owner).

FIRST ASSIGNMENT: Please review the user research from the discovery phase 
(link below) and come to our 1-on-1 tomorrow at 2pm with initial thoughts.

Morgan is also new to the company and may be a good person to connect with!

Let me know any questions.
Sarah
```

**Tomorrow:**
- 30-minute 1-on-1 with Alex
- Address their concerns
- Learn about them personally
- Build relationship

---

### Alex's Assumptions

**Assumptions Alex is making:**

1. **"Everyone else seems to know what they're doing"**
   - **Likely wrong:** Others probably also uncertain
   - Forming teams = everyone is figuring it out
   - Alex's anxiety makes them assume competence in others

2. **"If I ask too many questions, they'll think I'm not capable"**
   - **Wrong:** Questions signal engagement and intelligence
   - Good PMs WANT questions
   - Silence is more concerning than questions

3. **"Sarah's too busy to bother"**
   - **Wrong:** Answering questions IS Sarah's job
   - PMs should be most available during Forming
   - Sarah would want to know Alex feels lost

4. **"I should wait for the email"**
   - **Partially wrong:** Yes, wait, but also follow up if it doesn't come
   - Could have asked "When should I expect that?" in meeting

5. **"I'm probably overthinking this"**
   - **Wrong:** Alex's concerns are legitimate
   - Structure IS missing
   - Not overthinking, accurately perceiving gaps

---

### Impact of Introversion

**How Introversion Affects Alex's Experience:**

**Challenges:**
- Less likely to speak up in large meeting
- Raises hand "tentatively" rather than assertively
- Doesn't approach Sarah when others are present
- Sits alone rather than seeking connection
- Processes internally rather than talking through confusion

**An Extrovert Might:**
- Ask questions immediately and freely
- Approach Sarah after meeting despite others present
- Strike up conversations with team members
- Process confusion by talking it out
- Form connections quickly
- Feel energized by group meeting

**Neither is better, but PM must adapt:**
- Create multiple channels for questions (not just verbal)
- Offer 1-on-1s to introverts
- Don't assume silence = understanding
- Provide written documentation
- Create small group interactions (less overwhelming)

---

### Leadership Implications

**What Sarah Got Wrong:**

1. **"I'll send a document later"**
   - Should have had RACI ready for kickoff
   - "Parking" questions creates uncertainty
   - Document should be sent within hours, not days

2. **Didn't provide immediate clarity**
   - Kickoff should end with everyone knowing their first steps
   - No one should leave uncertain about what to do next

3. **No relationship building**
   - No ice breakers or personal introductions
   - All business, no human connection
   - Missed opportunity to build psychological safety

4. **Didn't check understanding**
   - Assumed silence = understanding
   - Didn't gauge how people were feeling
   - Moved too quickly through content

**What Sarah Should Have Done:**

**In the Kickoff Meeting:**
- Distribute RACI matrix during meeting (not after)
- Build in personal introductions (5 min each person shares about themselves)
- End with: "Your assignment for today: Review these documents, come to tomorrow's meeting with questions"
- Stay after to chat informally

**Immediately After:**
- Send comprehensive process docs within 2 hours
- Schedule 1-on-1s with everyone for this week
- Create Slack channel for questions
- Send "day 1 assignments" to give people starting point

**Leadership Style Needed:**
**Authoritative/Commanding** - Provide clear structure and direction

---

### Key Insight

**Alex's experience shows:**

**Forming stage is emotionally challenging:**
- Uncertainty creates anxiety
- Lack of connection creates isolation
- Ambiguity about role creates inadequacy
- This is NORMAL and PM must address it

**What feels obvious to PM may not be to team:**
- Sarah may think "they'll figure it out"
- Alex experiences it as "I have no idea what I'm doing"
- Gap between PM's assumptions and team member's reality

**Introverts need specific support:**
- Won't always speak up in groups
- Need written communication
- Appreciate 1-on-1 time
- Value clear structure
- May appear fine while struggling internally

**The first 48 hours matter immensely:**
- Sets tone for entire project
- Builds (or undermines) psychological safety
- Determines how quickly team progresses through Forming
- Alex will remember this first day forever

---

### Application to Your Leadership

**When your team is in Forming:**

**Remember Alex's experience:**
- That tentative hand raise
- Taking detailed notes
- Sitting alone at desk
- Not wanting to "bother" you
- Feeling inadequate
- Going home uncertain

**Ask yourself:**
- How many "Alexes" are on my team right now?
- What have I assumed they understand?
- When did I last check in on how they're really feeling?
- Have I provided enough structure?
- Are my introverts getting what they need?
- What emotional experience am I creating?

**Take action:**
- Provide comprehensive structure immediately
- Over-communicate in Forming stage
- Create multiple channels for questions
- Build in human connection
- Check understanding, don't assume it
- Individual check-ins, especially with quiet members

### Scenario 1B: Alex Four Weeks Later (Storming)

**YOU ARE: Still Alex, UX Designer**

**PROJECT STATUS: Week 4**

---

**WHAT'S HAPPENED SINCE WEEK 1:**

The first couple weeks were better after Sarah sent those process documents and you had a good 1-on-1. You started working on designs and felt more confident.

But now things are getting tense.

---

**TODAY'S DESIGN REVIEW MEETING:**

You're presenting your mockups for the main dashboard. You worked hard on these - stayed late two nights getting them right. You're proud of the design.

**You:** "So I've incorporated the user research insights into this dashboard design. The key actions are front and center, and I've—"

**Jordan (Dev Lead):** "Wait, this won't work. You've got the navigation on the left, but our framework uses top navigation. Redesigning the whole nav structure would add three weeks to the timeline."

**You:** "Oh, I didn't know about that constraint. Why wasn't that in the requirements?"

**Jordan:** "It's common knowledge about our tech stack. Any designer should know this."

*You feel your face getting hot. "Any designer should know this" - is he saying I'm incompetent?*

**You:** "Well, I'm new to the company, so I didn't know about your specific framework. If someone had told me—"

**Jordan:** "Sarah, did we not share the tech stack documentation?"

**Sarah:** "I think it was in the shared drive..."

**Jordan:** "Well, regardless, we can't use left navigation. Sorry, Alex, but you'll need to redesign."

*You worked so hard on this. And he just dismisses it. "Sorry, Alex" - he doesn't sound sorry at all.*

**Casey (jumping in):** "Actually, could we consider changing the framework? Left nav is a better UX pattern for this use case."

**Jordan:** "No. That would blow the timeline. We're using the existing framework."

**Casey:** "But if the UX is wrong—"

**Jordan:** "The UX isn't *wrong*, it just needs to fit our constraints."

*Jordan keeps interrupting. Sarah isn't saying anything. Does she agree with him?*

**You:** "I think there's a compromise here. What if—"

**Jordan:** "Look, I don't mean to be harsh, but we don't have time to debate this. Just move the nav to the top and we can move forward."

*The meeting continues but you're barely listening. You feel embarrassed, frustrated, and angry.*

---

**AFTER THE MEETING:**

You're back at your desk, staring at your mockups. Morgan walks by.

**Morgan:** "Hey, you okay? That meeting was rough."

**You:** "I'm fine."

**Morgan:** "Jordan can be... intense. Don't take it personally."

**You:** "He basically called me incompetent in front of everyone. And Sarah didn't say anything."

**Morgan:** "I know. She should have stepped in. Jordan does this to everyone, though. Last week he tore apart Casey's product requirements."

**You:** "Really?"

**Morgan:** "Yeah. Casey and I were talking about it. Jordan thinks he knows everything."

---

**YOUR INTERNAL MONOLOGUE:**

*"I can't believe Jordan humiliated me like that. 'Any designer should know this' - in front of the whole team. And Sarah just sat there.*

*Why didn't she defend me? Or at least acknowledge that the tech stack documentation wasn't clearly shared? It feels like she's siding with Jordan.*

*Now I have to redo two weeks of work. I'm so frustrated. I don't even want to work on this anymore.*

*Morgan's right - Jordan does this to everyone. He shot down Casey's ideas too. Why does Sarah let him dominate everything?*

*Maybe I should look for another project. Or another company. This isn't what I signed up for.*

*But I also wonder... was Jordan right? Should I have known about the tech stack? Am I actually not as good as I thought?*

*No, this isn't my fault. If it was documented in a shared drive that I didn't know existed, how was I supposed to find it?*

*God, I don't even want to go to tomorrow's standup. It'll be so awkward seeing Jordan. Do I apologize? Defend myself? Pretend it didn't happen?*

*I need to talk to Sarah. But what do I even say? 'Jordan was mean to me'? That sounds childish. But if I don't say something, how will this get better?*

*I miss my old team. We never had this kind of conflict."*

---

### Reflection Questions

**1. What stage is the team in now?**

**2. What emotions is Alex experiencing?**
   - How has this changed from Week 1?

**3. What does Alex need from Sarah RIGHT NOW?**
   - Be specific about actions

**4. What's really happening between Jordan and Alex?**
   - Is this personal? Technical? Something else?

**5. What mistakes has Sarah made in handling this?**

**6. If you were Sarah, what would you do in the next 24 hours?**
   - What would you say to Alex?
   - What would you say to Jordan?
   - What would you say to the team?

**7. How might this situation be an opportunity?**
   - What could the team learn?

## Analysis of Alex's Experience (Week 4)

### Stage Recognition

**The team has moved from Forming to Storming.**

**Evidence:**
- Open conflict (Jordan vs. Alex)
- PM authority questioned ("She should have stepped in")
- Coalitions forming (Morgan and Casey talking about Jordan)
- Personal tension ("Jordan thinks he knows everything")
- Productivity impact (two weeks of work needs redoing)
- Team members considering leaving
- Energy going to conflict, not work

---

### Emotional State

**Alex is now feeling:**

1. **Humiliated** - Called out in front of team
2. **Angry** - At Jordan and Sarah both
3. **Frustrated** - Hard work dismissed
4. **Confused** - Whose fault is this really?
5. **Self-doubting** - "Am I not as good as I thought?"
6. **Unsupported** - Sarah didn't defend them
7. **Anxious** - About tomorrow's standup
8. **Disconnected** - "I miss my old team"
9. **Vengeful** - Talking negatively about Jordan
10. **Uncertain** - Should I stay on this project?

**This is classic Storming stage emotional experience - much more intense than Forming.**

---

### What Really Happened

**Multi-Level Issues:**

**1. Communication Failure (PM's responsibility)**
- Tech stack constraints weren't clearly communicated to Alex
- "It was in the shared drive" = documentation exists but not accessible
- Alex couldn't possibly know to look for something they didn't know existed

**2. Jordan's Behavior (needs addressing)**
- Condescending tone ("any designer should know")
- Public criticism inappropriate
- Dismissive of Alex's work
- Steamrolling Casey's support

**3. Sarah's Failure to Facilitate (critical error)**
- Didn't intervene during public criticism
- Appeared to side with Jordan by silence
- Didn't acknowledge documentation gap
- Let Jordan dominate the discussion
- No facilitation of constructive resolution

**4. Legitimate Technical Constraint (real issue)**
- Framework limitation IS real
- Three weeks timeline impact IS significant
- Jordan's concern about constraints IS valid
- But delivery was terrible

**5. Coalition Formation (Storming indicator)**
- Morgan and Casey bonding over frustration with Jordan
- Negative talk about team member behind their back
- "Us vs. Jordan" dynamic forming

---

### What Alex Needs IMMEDIATELY

**Within 2 Hours of That Meeting:**

**Sarah should pull Alex aside (private 1-on-1):**

```
"Alex, can we talk privately for a few minutes?

First, I want to apologize. That meeting didn't go well, and I should have 
handled it better. Let me be clear: the issue with the tech stack 
documentation is on me, not you. I should have explicitly pointed you to 
those constraints when you started designing.

Second, Jordan's delivery was inappropriate. 'Any designer should know this' 
was condescending, and I should have addressed it in the moment. I'll be 
talking to Jordan separately about how we give feedback to each other.

Third, your design work is excellent. The left navigation IS better UX. 
Unfortunately, we have a real technical constraint we need to work within. 
But that doesn't diminish the quality of your thinking.

I know this is frustrating - you worked hard on this. How are you feeling 
about it? What do you need from me?"
```

**This response:**
- Acknowledges Alex's feelings
- Takes responsibility for documentation gap
- Addresses Jordan's behavior
- Validates Alex's work
- Acknowledges the real constraint
- Asks what Alex needs

---

**What Sarah Should Do Next:**

**1. With Jordan (private 1-on-1, today):**

"Jordan, we need to talk about this morning's design review.

You raised a legitimate technical concern - the framework constraint is real 
and three weeks is significant. But your delivery was problematic.

'Any designer should know this' came across as condescending. Alex is new to 
our company and our tech stack. They couldn't have known about constraints 
that weren't explicitly communicated.

I also noticed you interrupted Casey when they tried to support Alex's 
approach. We need everyone's input, not just yours.

Going forward, here's how I need us to handle design and technical 
discussions: [establish ground rules]

How do you see this situation?"

**2. With the Full Team (tomorrow's standup):**

"Team, I want to address yesterday's design review. It didn't go well, and 
that's on me as the leader.

Here's what I learned: We have information gaps. Some of you know our tech 
constraints, others don't. I need to do better documenting and communicating 
these upfront.

Second, we need to establish some ground rules for how we give feedback and 
handle disagreements. Here's what I'm proposing: [present ground rules]

This kind of friction is actually normal for teams at our stage. We're 
figuring out how to work together. The key is working through it 
constructively.

What else do we need to discuss about how we collaborate?"

---

### Jordan's Perspective (Important to Understand)

**Why Jordan might have reacted this way:**

**Jordan might be feeling:**
- Frustrated that Alex didn't know "basic" tech stack info
- Pressure about timeline (three weeks is significant)
- Protective of technical architecture
- Like his expertise is being questioned (Casey suggested changing framework)
- Anxious about project success

**Jordan's behavior is still inappropriate, but understanding his perspective helps:**
- He's not trying to be mean
- He has legitimate concerns
- His delivery is terrible
- He needs coaching on communication
- This is also Storming for him

**Sarah needs to address behavior while validating concerns.**

---

### What Sarah Got Wrong

**Critical Failures:**

1. **Didn't facilitate the conflict in the moment**
   - Should have intervened when Jordan was condescending
   - Could have said: "Jordan, I hear the technical constraint. Alex, I apologize - I should have shared that upfront. Let's take 10 minutes to brainstorm solutions together."

2. **Appeared to side with Jordan through silence**
   - Alex perceived Sarah's silence as agreement with Jordan
   - Silence is never neutral in conflict

3. **Didn't follow up immediately after meeting**
   - Should have pulled Alex aside right away
   - Waiting allows hurt and resentment to fester

4. **Didn't set ground rules for conflict earlier**
   - Should have established "how we disagree" in Forming stage
   - Now addressing after damage done

5. **Didn't acknowledge her own error**
   - Tech stack docs not clearly communicated = PM's responsibility
   - Should have owned this publicly

---

### The Opportunity Here

**This conflict, if handled well, can:**

1. **Establish healthy conflict norms**
   - Team learns how to disagree constructively
   - Sets precedent for future disagreements

2. **Build trust**
   - If Sarah facilitates well, team trusts she'll handle future conflicts
   - Alex learns Sarah will support them

3. **Clarify communication expectations**
   - Identifies gaps in documentation
   - Improves information sharing

4. **Move team toward Norming**
   - Working through Storming is necessary
   - This can accelerate progression if handled right

5. **Develop team members**
   - Jordan learns better communication
   - Alex learns to navigate conflict
   - All learn collaborative problem-solving

**If handled poorly:**
- Conflict goes underground
- Coalitions solidify
- People leave
- Team stays in Storming for months

---

### Comparison to Week 1

**Week 1 Alex:**
- Uncertain but hopeful
- Anxious but engaged
- Isolated but willing
- Self-doubting but trying

**Week 4 Alex:**
- Angry and defensive
- Humiliated and hurt
- Forming coalitions against Jordan
- Considering leaving

**This progression is NORMAL in Storming, but requires PM intervention.**

---

### Leadership Style Needed

**NOT Commanding (forcing a solution)**
- "Alex, just use top nav and move on" = suppresses conflict

**NOT Avoiding**
- Saying nothing = prolongs conflict

**YES Coaching/Facilitating**
- Help them work through it
- Establish constructive conflict norms
- Don't take sides, facilitate resolution
- Teach team how to disagree well

**With Affiliative elements**
- Acknowledge emotions
- Repair relationships
- Build trust through care

---

### Key Insight

**Alex's Storming experience shows:**

**Storming is emotionally intense:**
- Much harder than Forming
- Personal and painful
- Tests commitment to team and project
- Makes people question themselves and others

**PM's role is critical:**
- Silence = taking a side
- Must actively facilitate
- Can't avoid or force
- Must acknowledge emotions while solving problems

**Conflict reveals gaps:**
- Documentation issues
- Communication problems
- Role clarity needs
- Process improvements needed

**The first major conflict sets the tone:**
- If handled well → team learns constructive conflict
- If handled poorly → team learns to avoid or escalate

---

### Application to Your Leadership

**When your team hits Storming:**

**Remember Alex's experience:**
- That humiliation in the meeting
- Sarah's silence feeling like betrayal
- Questioning if they should stay
- Forming negative coalitions
- Losing enthusiasm for work

**Don't make Sarah's mistakes:**
- Don't stay silent during public criticism
- Don't let conflicts fester
- Don't let one person dominate
- Don't avoid difficult conversations

**Do facilitate constructively:**
- Intervene in the moment (respectfully)
- Follow up immediately after conflict
- Talk to all parties privately
- Address with full team (establish norms)
- Acknowledge your own failures
- Focus on learning, not blame

**Most important:**
Storming is NECESSARY. Teams that avoid or suppress conflict never reach high performance. Your job is to facilitate them through it constructively, not eliminate it.

## Part 2: Different People, Same Leadership Style

### Scenario 2: Production Crisis - Four Perspectives

**SITUATION: Production System Crashed**

The customer-facing application went down at 10:47 AM. Customers cannot log in. Support is getting angry calls. The executive team is asking for updates. 

Your PM (Chris) responds immediately with a Commanding leadership style.

**Now experience this moment from four different team members' perspectives.**

---

### Perspective A: Casey (Junior Developer, 6 months experience)

**YOU ARE: Casey**

**Your Background:**
- First job out of coding bootcamp
- 6 months professional experience
- Smart but inexperienced with production issues
- Eager to learn but easily overwhelmed
- This is your first production outage

---

**WHAT HAPPENS:**

You see the alerts come through. Your heart starts racing. *Oh god, the whole system is down. What do I do?*

You start opening logs but there's so much data you don't know where to start. *Database errors? API timeouts? Is it on our end or AWS? I don't know what I'm looking for.*

Chris's voice comes over the video call, clear and firm:

**Chris:** "Everyone stop what you're doing. Here's what we're doing right now. Casey - check the API gateway logs for errors in the past 30 minutes. Filter for 500-level errors. Send me the count in the #incident channel. Do that first, nothing else."

*Oh thank god. Okay, I can do that. API gateway logs, 500-level errors, past 30 minutes. That's clear.*

You navigate to the logs, apply the filters Chris specified. You find 247 errors. You post in Slack: "247 500-level errors in API gateway"

**Chris:** "Good, Casey. Now check if they're all from the same endpoint or distributed. Post findings."

You run the query. "All from /api/auth/login endpoint"

**Chris:** "Perfect. Stand by."

*My hands have stopped shaking. I know what I'm doing now. Chris is handling this. We're going to fix it.*

---

**YOUR INTERNAL THOUGHTS:**

*"I was panicking, but Chris's clear instructions helped me focus. I didn't have to figure out what to do - he told me exactly what. That's what I needed.*

*I know some people don't like being told what to do, but in a crisis like this? I'm relieved someone with experience is taking charge. I wouldn't have known where to start.*

*Chris trusts me to do this specific task. It's small enough I can handle it, but important enough to matter. I feel useful, not useless.*

*I'm learning what to look for in a production issue. Next time, maybe I'll know how to start investigating on my own."*

---

### Perspective B: Jordan (Senior Developer, 12 years experience)

**YOU ARE: Jordan**

**Your Background:**
- 12 years as a software engineer
- You've handled dozens of production outages
- Very experienced with this codebase
- Pride yourself on quick problem diagnosis
- Independent and confident

---

**WHAT HAPPENS:**

You see the alerts. *System's down. Okay, let's see...*

You immediately start investigating. You pull up monitoring dashboards, check recent deployments, scan error logs. You're mentally building a hypothesis: *Probably the authentication service. The deployment from yesterday might have—*

Chris's voice cuts into your concentration:

**Chris:** "Everyone stop what you're doing. Here's what we're doing. Jordan - check the database connection pool. Count active connections vs. max connections. Report back in 5 minutes."

*Wait, what? The database connection pool? That's not where the problem is. This is clearly an auth service issue, not a database problem.*

But Chris keeps going, giving orders to everyone.

You check the connection pool anyway because Chris told you to. *47 active connections, max is 100. Plenty of capacity. This is a waste of time.*

You post: "Connection pool fine. 47 active."

You're about to explain your theory about the auth service, but Chris is already directing someone else.

*I could have had this diagnosed by now if he'd just let me investigate. I already had a hypothesis. Now I'm checking things I know aren't the problem because Chris is micromanaging everyone.*

---

**YOUR INTERNAL THOUGHTS:**

*"I get that Chris is trying to coordinate, but this feels like he doesn't trust me to do my job. I've handled more outages than he has.*

*That task he gave me was something a junior could do. I'm capable of leading the investigation, not just running a single query.*

*If he'd asked 'Jordan, what do you need to investigate?' instead of telling me what to check, we'd probably be further along.*

*This command-and-control approach might work for Casey, but it's frustrating for me. I'm not a soldier following orders, I'm an experienced engineer who can troubleshoot.*

*I want to respect Chris's role as PM, but this is making me less effective, not more."*

---

### Perspective C: Morgan (Developer with performance anxiety)

**YOU ARE: Morgan**

**Your Background:**
- 4 years development experience
- Competent developer but struggles with anxiety
- Performance anxiety worsens under pressure
- Doctor-diagnosed anxiety disorder
- Managing well with therapy and medication, but stress still triggers symptoms

---

**WHAT HAPPENS:**

You see the alerts. Your chest tightens immediately. *Oh no, not now. Everyone's going to see if I mess this up.*

Your hands start trembling slightly. You try to pull up logs but accidentally close the wrong window. *Come on, focus. Everyone else is probably already investigating. I'm behind.*

Chris's voice is sharp and urgent:

**Chris (loudly):** "Everyone STOP. Here's what we're doing RIGHT NOW. Morgan - check Redis cache status. Is it up? Are we getting hits or misses? Report back IMMEDIATELY."

*His tone is so intense. This must be really bad. Okay, Redis, Redis...*

Your heart is pounding. You try to SSH into the Redis server but you typo the command. *Shit. Everyone can see this in the terminal. They'll know I'm panicking.*

You try again, hands shaking worse. You get in.

Chris's voice again: "Morgan, where's the Redis status? Need it now."

*I'm going as fast as I can! The pressure is making it worse.*

You finally get the info: "Redis is up, showing 73% hit rate"

**Chris:** "Okay. Stand by for next task."

*I did it. But I feel like I'm going to throw up. My heart won't stop racing. I hate feeling this way.*

---

**YOUR INTERNAL THOUGHTS:**

*"Chris's commanding approach makes the crisis feel even more urgent and intense. I know he's trying to coordinate, but the barking orders raises my anxiety.*

*When he said 'RIGHT NOW' and 'IMMEDIATELY,' it made me more panicked, not more effective. I started making typos and mistakes.*

*If he'd said 'Morgan, when you can, check Redis status and let me know' - same request, less panic-inducing.*

*I know I have anxiety issues that aren't Chris's fault. But his leadership style is amplifying my anxiety, not helping me manage it.*

*After this is over, I'm going to be exhausted. The crisis itself plus managing my panic response - it's draining.*

*I wish I could tell Chris that I work better with calm direction than urgent barking. But I don't want him to think I can't handle pressure."*

---

### Perspective D: Taylor (Developer who needs context)

**YOU ARE: Taylor**

**Your Background:**
- 8 years development experience
- Analytical thinker who needs to understand the "why"
- Makes good decisions when you understand the full picture
- Can execute tasks but works better when you understand the strategy
- Values autonomy and context

---

**WHAT HAPPENS:**

You see the alerts and start investigating. You're trying to understand the full scope: *What services are down? What's the user impact? Where should we focus first?*

Chris jumps on the call:

**Chris:** "Taylor - check the load balancer health checks. Tell me which instances are responding."

You start checking, but you're thinking: *Why the load balancer? What's his theory about root cause? What have others found?*

You find the info: "All instances responding to health checks"

**Chris:** "Good. Now check the SSL certificate expiration dates."

*SSL certificates? That seems random. Is he just throwing out tasks or does he have a hypothesis? I wish I understood his thinking.*

You check: "Certificates valid for 89 more days"

**Chris:** "Okay, stand by."

*I'm just running random checks. I have no idea if we're getting closer to the problem or not. Are we working from a theory or just checking everything we can think of?*

---

**YOUR INTERNAL THOUGHTS:**

*"I'm following orders but I don't understand the strategy. That makes it hard for me to know if my findings are important or not.*

*When I found all instances were healthy, I didn't know if that was good news (not a deployment issue) or bad news (the problem is somewhere else). Chris just said 'good' and moved on.*

*If Chris had said 'I think this might be a routing issue, I need you to check load balancer health checks to rule that out' - I'd understand why I'm doing this and what to look for.*

*I can follow instructions, but I'm much more effective when I understand the context. Right now I'm a robot executing commands.*

*I also have insights about this system that could help, but there's no space for me to share them. It's all top-down direction.*

*Once we fix this, I probably won't understand WHY my findings mattered or what I learned for next time."*

### Reflection Questions

**1. How did the SAME leadership style (Commanding) affect these four people differently?**
   - What worked for whom?
   - What didn't work for whom?

**2. Was Commanding the right style for this situation?**
   - Why or why not?
   - What makes it appropriate?

**3. How could Chris have adapted his approach to address different needs?**
   - What could he do for Jordan?
   - For Morgan?
   - For Taylor?
   - While still keeping Casey supported?

**4. After the crisis is over, what should Chris do?**
   - How should he address the different experiences?

**5. What does this teach you about "one size fits all" leadership?**

**6. Which person's perspective resonates most with you?**
   - Why?
   - What does that tell you about your own needs as a team member?

## Analysis: Same Style, Different Impact

### The Fundamental Insight

**Commanding leadership style affected four people in four completely different ways:**

1. **Casey (Junior):** Helped, reduced panic, provided structure
2. **Jordan (Senior):** Frustrated, felt micromanaged, less effective
3. **Morgan (Anxious):** Increased anxiety, made crisis feel worse
4. **Taylor (Context-seeker):** Confused, operating blindly, unused potential

**This is the core lesson about situational leadership: There is no "best" style that works for everyone in all situations.**

---

### Was Commanding Appropriate?

**YES and NO:**

**Reasons Commanding WAS Appropriate:**
- ✅ True emergency (production down, customers impacted)
- ✅ Immediate action required
- ✅ Need for coordination (people need specific tasks to avoid duplication)
- ✅ Time-critical situation (discussion wastes precious minutes)
- ✅ Some team members need structure (Casey benefited enormously)

**Reasons Commanding Was PROBLEMATIC:**
- ❌ Not everyone needs/wants it (Jordan actively hindered)
- ❌ Doesn't leverage expertise (Jordan's experience wasted)
- ❌ Increases some people's stress (Morgan's anxiety amplified)
- ❌ Misses insights (Taylor had potential contributions)
- ❌ Doesn't build capability (Taylor won't learn from this)

**Conclusion:** 
Commanding was appropriate for the SITUATION (emergency) but Chris could have adapted the WAY he commanded to different people's needs.

---

### How Chris Could Have Done Better

**Better Approach: Commanding with Adaptation**

**At the Start (same for everyone):**
"Production is down. We need to investigate quickly and systematically. Here's how we'll coordinate..."

**Then Adapt:**

**For Casey (Junior):**
✅ **What Chris did was RIGHT:**
- Specific, clear instructions
- Simple, achievable task
- Immediate direction
- Regular check-ins
- Positive reinforcement ("Good, Casey")

**Keep doing this for junior team members in crisis.**

---

**For Jordan (Senior):**
❌ **What Chris did was WRONG**
❌ **Better approach:**

"Jordan, you've handled more outages than anyone. What's your hypothesis about root cause? What do you need to investigate?"

Then: 
"Okay, you lead the auth service investigation. Keep me posted every 5 minutes."

**Why this is better:**
- Leverages Jordan's expertise
- Gives autonomy within coordination
- Respects his experience
- Still provides coordination (5-min updates)
- Makes Jordan more effective, not less

**Commanding can still happen, but with autonomy for senior people:**
- Junior: "Do X, then Y, then report"
- Senior: "You handle X domain, update me every Y minutes"

---

**For Morgan (Anxious):**
❌ **What Chris did was WRONG**
❌ **Better approach:**

"Morgan, I need you to check Redis cache status when you're able. Let me know what you find - no rush, I'm gathering info from everyone."

**Tone matters:**
- Calm, not urgent barking
- "When you're able" vs. "RIGHT NOW"
- Confidence that Morgan will deliver
- Not adding pressure

**After Morgan reports:**
"Thanks, Morgan. That's helpful. Stand by."

**Why this is better:**
- Same task, less panic-inducing delivery
- Acknowledges good work (reduces anxiety)
- Calm leadership helps Morgan stay calm
- Morgan gets task done MORE effectively with less anxiety

**Key learning:**
Even in crisis, HOW you communicate affects people's ability to perform. Calm urgency > panicked urgency.

---

**For Taylor (Context-seeker):**
❌ **What Chris did was WRONG**
❌ **Better approach:**

"Taylor, I'm thinking this might be a routing or configuration issue since the alerts started after yesterday's deployment. Can you check load balancer and SSL cert status? I want to rule out infrastructure before we dive into application code."

Then after Taylor reports:
"Okay, good - that rules out infrastructure. Helps us narrow it down. Stand by."

**Why this is better:**
- Provides context (the WHY)
- Shares hypothesis
- Explains what findings mean
- Taylor understands contribution
- Can offer insights if hypothesis is wrong

**Additional:**
"Taylor, you know this system well - if you see something off in your investigation, speak up."

**Opens door for Taylor's insights while still providing direction.**

---

### The Adapted Approach

**What Chris SHOULD Have Done:**

**Step 1: Assess quickly (30 seconds)**
- Casey = junior, needs clear direction
- Jordan = senior, needs autonomy
- Morgan = needs calm approach
- Taylor = needs context

**Step 2: Coordinate with adaptation**

"Everyone, production is down. Here's how we'll investigate:

Casey - Check API gateway logs for 500-errors in past 30 minutes. I'll tell you exactly what to filter for.

Jordan - You lead the authentication service investigation. Your call on what to check. Update me every 5 minutes.

Morgan - When you can, check Redis cache status and let me know what you find.

Taylor - I think this might be routing related. Check load balancer health and SSL certs to rule out infrastructure.

Everyone report in #incident channel. Let's move."

**This approach:**
- Still decisive and coordinating (crisis needs this)
- Adapts to each person's needs
- Leverages strengths
- Minimizes weaknesses
- More effective overall

---

### After the Crisis

**Chris should:**

**1. Debrief with Team (within 24 hours)**
"Let's talk about how we handled that incident. What worked? What could we improve?"

**2. Individual Check-ins**

**With Casey:**
"How did you feel during the incident? That was your first production outage. What did you learn?"
- Reinforce what they did well
- Build confidence
- Teach from experience

**With Jordan:**
"I know I was pretty directive during the incident. How did that land for you?"
- Acknowledge his expertise
- Ask for feedback
- Adjust for next time

**With Morgan:**
"How are you doing after yesterday? I know incidents are stressful."
- Check on well-being
- Morgan might share about anxiety
- Plan for future (what helps Morgan work best under pressure?)

**With Taylor:**
"I gave you specific tasks without much context during the incident. Did that work for you?"
- Get feedback
- Explain thinking retroactively
- Adjust for next time

**3. Document Learnings**
Not just technical root cause, but:
- How we coordinated
- What worked in our incident response
- How to communicate during crisis
- Individual preferences and needs

---

### The "One Size Fits All" Myth

**This scenario destroys the myth that there's one "best" leadership style:**

**If Chris only did what Casey needed:**
- Jordan frustrated and underutilized
- Morgan's anxiety increased
- Taylor operating blindly

**If Chris only did what Jordan needed:**
- Casey would have panicked
- Morgan might have shut down
- Taylor might have been okay

**The truth:**
Great leaders adapt their approach to:
- The situation (emergency = more directive)
- The individual (junior vs. senior, anxious vs. confident)
- The task (simple vs. complex)
- The relationship (new vs. established trust)

---

### Which Perspective Resonates?

**Casey's Perspective:**
If this resonates, you:
- Value clear direction
- Appreciate structure in chaos
- Want guidance from experienced leaders
- Learn by following then doing
- Thrive with explicit instructions

**Your needs as team member:**
- Clear expectations
- Regular feedback
- Step-by-step guidance
- Patient explanation
- Building confidence through small successes

---

**Jordan's Perspective:**
If this resonates, you:
- Value autonomy
- Want to use your expertise
- Prefer strategy over tactics
- Can lead, not just follow
- Frustrated by micromanagement

**Your needs as team member:**
- Trust and autonomy
- Strategic direction, not tactical
- Recognition of expertise
- Space to lead in your domain
- Input on approach, not just execution

---

**Morgan's Perspective:**
If this resonates, you:
- Sensitive to tone and pressure
- Perform better in calm environments
- Need psychological safety to be effective
- Anxious under intense scrutiny
- Value steady, supportive leadership

**Your needs as team member:**
- Calm, steady leadership
- Psychological safety
- Patience with processing time
- Understanding of anxiety as real
- Confidence-building rather than pressure

---

**Taylor's Perspective:**
If this resonates, you:
- Need to understand WHY
- Think strategically
- Want to see the big picture
- Frustrated by blind task execution
- Have insights to share

**Your needs as team member:**
- Context and rationale
- Understanding the strategy
- Opportunity to contribute ideas
- Explanation of how pieces fit together
- Trusted with the full picture

---

### Application to Your Leadership

**When you're leading in crisis:**

**Before crisis (preparation):**
- Know your team members
- Understand their experience levels
- Learn their working styles
- Know their triggers and needs
- Build trust during normal times

**During crisis:**
- Quick mental assessment (30 seconds)
- Adapt approach to each person
- Still coordinate and direct
- But do it in ways that work for each person
- Leverage strengths

**After crisis:**
- Debrief as team
- Individual check-ins
- Acknowledge different experiences
- Learn for next time
- Improve coordination

**Most important:**
**Commanding style is sometimes necessary (emergencies, crises, safety issues), but HOW you command can still be adapted to individual needs.**

**You can be:**
- Directive with Casey (detailed instructions)
- Directive with Jordan (strategic direction, tactical autonomy)
- Directive with Morgan (calm, steady, confidence-building)
- Directive with Taylor (context-rich, strategy-explained)

**All are directive. All are different. All are more effective.**

## Part 3: Full Journey Through Stages

### Scenario 3: Robin's Eight-Month Journey

**YOU ARE: Robin, Full-Stack Developer**

**Background:**
- 3 years development experience
- Confident technical skills
- New to this company
- First time on a long-term project (previous roles were consulting with 3-month engagements)
- Enthusiastic and optimistic

---

**MONTH 1 - FORMING**

*You're excited. New company, new project, new team. This is going to be great.*

First team meeting. The PM (Sarah) seems nice. She introduces everyone:
- Jordan (dev lead) - quiet, serious
- Alex (UX) - friendly smile
- Casey (QA) - taking lots of notes
- Morgan (BA) - waves hello
- Taylor (dev) - types while Sarah talks

Everyone's professional. You're trying to remember names and roles.

Sarah shares the project charter. *Ambitious timeline. Complex requirements. This will be challenging.*

You raise your hand: "What development environment do we use?"

Sarah: "Great question! I'll send setup instructions this afternoon."

*Okay, so I'll wait for that email. What should I do until then?*

---

**YOUR THOUGHTS (Month 1):**

*"Everyone seems competent and professional. I'm the new person - I should probably just listen and learn for a bit. Don't want to come on too strong.*

*Sarah's organized. Jordan seems to know his stuff. I think I can learn a lot here.*

*Bit confused about the approval process for code changes, but I'm sure they'll explain that. I'll just wait and see how others do it.*

*This is so different from consulting. Three-month projects, you hit the ground running. Eight months feels like forever. We have time to do this right."*

**How you feel:** Optimistic, slightly nervous, eager to prove yourself, patient

---

**MONTH 2 - EARLY STORMING**

*You've been here a month. You're starting to see... issues.*

In today's planning meeting, you suggested a refactoring approach. 

Jordan immediately shot it down: "That would add risk. We're keeping the current architecture."

*No discussion? Just... no?*

You pushed back gently: "But the current approach has these problems..."

Jordan cut you off: "I've been working with this codebase for years. Trust me."

Alex jumped in: "Actually, Robin might have a point—"

Jordan: "We're not refactoring. Next item."

Sarah just moved on to the next agenda item.

*Did Sarah just let Jordan shut down discussion without even considering it? Is that how decisions get made here?*

---

**YOUR THOUGHTS (Month 2):**

*"Jordan's territorial about the codebase. Any suggestion I make, he dismisses. Is it because I'm new? Or does he do this to everyone?*

*I've noticed Jordan and Alex disagree a lot. Sarah doesn't really intervene. She just lets them argue and then eventually someone wins through exhaustion.*

*I thought I was hired for my expertise, but Jordan seems to think his way is the only way.*

*The three-month consulting gigs are looking pretty good right now. If I didn't like a team, I knew it would end soon. Eight months of this?"*

**How you feel:** Frustrated, undervalued, questioning if you fit here, defensive

---

**MONTH 3 - PEAK STORMING**

*That meeting with Jordan yesterday was rough.*

You and Jordan had a heated debate about testing strategy. You both got emotional. Voices were raised. It got personal.

Afterward, Alex found you: "Don't take it personally. Jordan's like that with everyone."

Casey agreed: "He and I argued for two hours last month about requirements."

*So it's not just me. But that doesn't make it better.*

You almost went to Sarah to complain, but then thought: *What would I even say? "Jordan's mean to me"? That sounds childish.*

But you also thought about updating your resume.

---

**YOUR THOUGHTS (Month 3):**

*"This is the worst team dynamic I've ever experienced. In consulting, if teams didn't gel, we'd reorganize or just push through the short project. This is miserable.*

*Jordan and I can barely be in the same meeting anymore. Every technical decision turns into a battle.*

*Sarah must see this. Why isn't she doing anything?*

*Five more months of this. I don't know if I can do it."*

**How you feel:** Miserable, angry, considering leaving, resentful

---

**MONTH 4 - TURNING POINT**

*Something changed this week.*

Sarah finally intervened. She pulled you and Jordan into a room with her.

Sarah: "We need to talk about how you two are working together. Or not working together."

She didn't take sides. She acknowledged you both had legitimate perspectives. She facilitated a real conversation about technical approach using objective criteria.

You and Jordan actually talked. Really talked. Not argued - talked.

You realized: Jordan's not trying to be difficult. He's worried about timeline and risk. His concerns are legitimate.

Jordan realized: You're not trying to change everything recklessly. You see real problems that need addressing.

You compromised. Jordan's timeline concerns + your technical improvements = a middle approach you both agree with.

Sarah: "This is what I should have facilitated a month ago. My fault for not stepping in sooner."

---

**After that meeting, Jordan caught up with you in the hallway:**

"Hey, want to grab coffee? I owe you an apology."

Over coffee, Jordan explained his history with this codebase and why he was so defensive. You shared your consulting background and why you push for changes.

You left thinking: *Jordan's actually a good guy. We just got off on the wrong foot.*

---

**YOUR THOUGHTS (Month 4):**

*"Why didn't we do this two months ago? So much wasted time and stress.*

*But now I understand Jordan. And I think he understands me.*

*Sarah's approach in that meeting was perfect. She didn't force a solution or take a side. She helped us work through it.*

*I feel like we can actually work together now. The team feels different this week."*

**How you feel:** Relieved, hopeful, understanding, re-engaged

---

**MONTH 5 - NORMING**

*We're actually functioning as a team now.*

Standups feel productive. When someone's blocked, three people jump in to help. You and Jordan collaborated on a complex feature this week - it went great.

The team has started using "we" language. "Our codebase." "Our approach." "How should we handle this?"

You suggested a process improvement yesterday. Instead of Jordan shooting it down, the team discussed it. You refined it together. Now you're trying it in this sprint.

Alex invited everyone to happy hour Friday. Six of you went. You actually had fun.

*This is what a team should feel like.*

---

**YOUR THOUGHTS (Month 5):**

*"I'm so glad I didn't leave after Month 3. This is actually a great team now.*

*Working with Jordan is enjoyable. We have a good rhythm. We challenge each other's thinking, but constructively now.*

*We've established processes that work. Everyone knows how decisions get made. We have ground rules for disagreement.*

*I'm learning a lot. This is what I wanted when I took this job."*

**How you feel:** Comfortable, engaged, productive, proud of the team

---

**MONTH 6 - PERFORMING**

*We're crushing it.*

This week we delivered a complex feature ahead of schedule. The team self-organized the work - Sarah barely needed to be involved.

When a production issue came up, we handled it. Diagnosed it, fixed it, deployed the patch, communicated to stakeholders. Sarah was in a meeting. We didn't even wait for her.

Alex got stuck on a UX problem. You, Jordan, and Casey brainstormed with them for 30 minutes. Solved it together. No egos, just problem-solving.

New developer (Sam) joined the team this week. The team onboarded them together. Sarah didn't have to coordinate it. We just... did it.

*This is the best team I've ever been on.*

---

**YOUR THOUGHTS (Month 6):**

*"I would have quit in Month 3 if someone had told me it would get this good, I wouldn't have believed them.*

*We don't just work well together - we're excellent together. The sum is greater than the parts.*

*Jordan and I joke now about our Month 2 arguments. It seems silly in retrospect, but Sarah says it was necessary for us to become this.*

*Sarah's role has changed. She's not managing us day-to-day. She removes obstacles, handles stakeholders, and trusts us. That trust feels good.*

*Three months ago I wanted to leave. Now I don't want this project to end."*

**How you feel:** Fulfilled, confident, valued, connected, excellent

---

**MONTH 7 - STILL PERFORMING**

*The excellence continues.*

We shipped another major feature. Quality was high. Stakeholders are thrilled.

The team is innovating. We're not just executing - we're finding better ways to do things. We improved the testing automation. We optimized the build process. We're continuously improving.

Sam (who joined last month) is contributing at full speed. The team brought them up to speed so effectively.

You're mentoring Sam on architecture patterns. A month ago, they asked you to explain something. Today, you're teaching. *That's a role shift I didn't expect but enjoy.*

---

**YOUR THOUGHTS (Month 7):**

*"Performing stage is real. This isn't just a good week - we've been operating at this level for weeks. It's sustained excellence.*

*We anticipate problems before they become problems. We self-correct. We support each other naturally.*

*Sarah's focused on the next project transition and stakeholder management. We run the day-to-day.*

*I'm doing the best work of my career. Not just because of my individual contribution, but because of what we create together."*

**How you feel:** Proud, accomplished, trusted, autonomous, grateful

---

**MONTH 8 - ADJOURNING**

*Two weeks left.*

Yesterday Jordan announced he got promoted - he's moving to lead another team. You're genuinely happy for him, but also sad. *This team won't be the same without him.*

At standup this morning, Alex mentioned they're going to a different project next month. Casey might be on your next project, but Taylor's leaving the company.

*We're disbanding. This team that took 4 months to become great is ending just when we hit our stride.*

---

**FINAL TEAM RETROSPECTIVE - YOUR TURN TO SHARE:**

Sarah: "Robin, what will you remember most about this team?"

You pause, feeling emotional:

"Honestly? Month 3, I almost quit. I was miserable. Jordan and I couldn't work together. I thought this was the worst team I'd ever been on.

Now, eight months later, it's the BEST team I've ever been on. 

I'll remember that month where Sarah finally helped Jordan and me work through our conflict. That coffee conversation. The moment I realized Jordan wasn't the enemy - we just didn't understand each other yet.

I'll remember Month 6 when we handled that production issue without Sarah and realized we'd become autonomous and excellent.

I'll remember that this team taught me that great teams aren't born - they're built. Through conflict, through difficulty, through working together over time.

And I'll take that knowledge to every team I'm on from now on.

Thank you all."

*You're crying a little. So is Alex. Jordan gives you a fist bump.*

---

**LAST DAY - YOUR THOUGHTS:**

*"I'm going to miss this team. We built something special.*

*But I'm also grateful for the journey - ALL of it. Even the hard parts. Especially the hard parts. Month 3's conflict made Month 6's excellence possible.*

*I'm excited about my next project, but I know the new team will start at Month 1. We'll have to build trust again. Work through conflicts again. Find our groove again.*

*But now I know it's possible. And I know my role in making it happen.*

*I hope I work with these people again. I hope I build teams this good again. I know what great feels like now."*

**How you feel:** Grateful, sad, proud, nostalgic, hopeful, changed

### The Crisis Point (Month 3)

**Robin was closest to quitting in Month 3.**

**Why Robin Didn't Quit:**

1. **Didn't want to look like a quitter**
   - "Five more months" felt survivable even if miserable
   - Professional pride

2. **Uncertainty about alternatives**
   - Job market concerns
   - Fear next team might be worse
   - "Better the devil you know"

3. **Small hope things might improve**
   - Alex and Casey's empathy helped
   - Realized Jordan treats everyone this way (not personal)
   - Tiny thread of "maybe it will get better"

4. **Sarah intervened before Robin quit**
   - The Month 4 facilitation was JUST in time
   - If it had gone another month, Robin would have left

**Critical Learning for PMs:**
**You don't know when team members are at their breaking point.**

Robin never told Sarah they were considering leaving. Sarah found out in the final retrospective that Robin almost quit.

**How many Robins are on your team right now?**
- Looking miserable but not saying anything
- One more bad week from quitting
- Waiting for you to do something

**Don't wait for people to tell you they're struggling. Facilitate through Storming proactively.**

---

### What Sarah Got Right

**Month 4 Intervention:**
- Finally facilitated the Jordan-Robin conflict
- Used structured discussion with objective criteria
- Didn't take sides
- Helped them understand each other
- Created space for relationship repair

**Month 5-7 Empowerment:**
- Stepped back as team reached Norming/Performing
- Trusted team's autonomy
- Focused on obstacles and stakeholders
- Didn't micromanage

**Month 8 Closure:**
- Created space for reflection
- Robin felt safe sharing vulnerability
- Proper celebration and recognition
- Closure activities

---

### What Sarah Got Wrong

**Month 2-3 Avoidance:**
- Let Jordan-Robin conflict fester for 2 months
- Didn't facilitate early
- Assumed they'd work it out
- Nearly lost a team member

**Should Have Intervened:**
- First time Jordan shut down Robin's idea without discussion
- When conflict became personal
- When Robin started withdrawing

**Cost of Waiting:**
- 2 months of misery for Robin
- 2 months of reduced productivity
- 2 months of team dysfunction
- Nearly lost Robin permanently

**Critical Learning:**
**Waiting to see if Storming resolves itself is a mistake. Facilitate proactively, not reactively.**

---

### If Robin Had Quit (Month 3)

**What Would Have Been Lost:**

**For Robin:**
- Never experienced high-performing team
- Never learned that great teams are built through conflict
- Never developed relationship with Jordan
- Never saw that Month 3 struggles lead to Month 6 excellence
- Career-limiting learning opportunity missed
- Would have pattern of leaving when teams get hard

**For the Team:**
- Lost Robin's technical expertise
- Lost diverse perspective (consulting background)
- Lost future mentoring of Sam
- Team dynamic disrupted
- Message sent: "When things get hard, leave"
- Jordan might never have learned to be less territorial

**For the Project:**
- Timeline impact (finding replacement, onboarding)
- Quality impact (lost expertise)
- Morale impact (team failure in Storming)
- Never reached Performing stage potential

**For Sarah:**
- Failed as leader (couldn't keep team together)
- Reputation damage
- Opportunity for growth lost
- Pattern established (avoid conflict until people leave)

**Critical Insight:**
**The cost of not facilitating through Storming is MASSIVE, often hidden, and long-lasting.**

---

### The Value of Conflict (Jordan-Robin)

**Was the conflict necessary?**

**YES. Absolutely.**

**What Robin learned through conflict with Jordan:**

1. **Different perspectives have value**
   - Jordan's timeline concerns were legitimate
   - Robin's technical concerns were legitimate
   - Both were right about different things

2. **Conflict can be constructive**
   - Month 3 conflict was destructive
   - Month 4 facilitated conflict was constructive
   - Same people, same issues, different process

3. **Understanding comes through difficulty**
   - Surface politeness (Month 1) didn't build real relationship
   - Working through conflict (Month 4) built trust and understanding
   - Can't get to deep trust without navigating difficulty

4. **Great teams aren't born, they're built**
   - Month 6 excellence was earned through Month 3 difficulty
   - Shortcut doesn't exist
   - Have to go through Storming to reach Performing

5. **People aren't the enemy**
   - Jordan wasn't trying to be difficult
   - Understanding motivations changes everything
   - Coffee conversation was as important as facilitated meeting

**Robin's realization in final retrospective:**
"Month 3's conflict made Month 6's excellence possible."

**This is the fundamental truth about team development:**
**You can't skip Storming. You can only facilitate through it constructively.**

---

### Month 3 vs. Month 8: Same Team, Different Reality

**Month 3 Robin:**
- "Worst team I've ever been on"
- Wants to leave
- Sees Jordan as obstacle
- Feels undervalued
- Questions if they fit
- Miserable daily

**Month 8 Robin:**
- "BEST team I've ever been on"
- Doesn't want it to end
- Sees Jordan as valued colleague and friend
- Feels trusted and autonomous
- Knows they fit perfectly
- Fulfilled and excellent

**SAME TEAM. SAME PEOPLE. DIFFERENT STAGE.**

**What Changed:**

**Not the people:**
- Jordan is still Jordan
- Robin is still Robin
- Everyone's personalities unchanged

**What changed:**
- They worked through conflict
- They built trust through difficulty
- They established processes
- They learned to work together
- They progressed through stages

**Critical Learning:**
**When you're in Month 3, you can't imagine Month 8 is possible. But it is.**

**When team members say:**
- "This team is terrible"
- "We can't work together"
- "I want off this project"

**They might be in Month 3 of a journey to Month 8 excellence.**
**Your job as leader is to facilitate that journey, not accept Month 3 as permanent reality.**

### What Robin Takes Forward

**Robin is now a different team member because of this experience:**

**Before (consulting background):**
- Expected instant team cohesion

- Expected smooth relationships

**After (8-month journey):**
- Knows great teams take months to build
- Long-term thinking
- Willing to work through difficulty
- Sees conflict as necessary

- Robin won't panic or quit
- Robin will remember: "This is Month 3. Month 8 is coming."

- Robin will help others understand stages

**Robin's advantage:**
- Has experienced full journey

**This is the long-term value of experiencing the full team development journey.**

### The Tuckman Model in Action

**Robin's experience perfectly illustrates all five stages:**

**Forming (Month 1):**
- ✓ New team
- ✓ Polite, professional
- ✓ Questions about process
- ✓ Uncertainty about roles
- ✓ Tentative engagement
- ✓ Dependent on PM

**Storming (Months 2-3):**
- ✓ Conflict with Jordan
- ✓ Challenging ideas
- ✓ Frustration with PM
- ✓ Coalition formation (Robin-Alex-Casey)
- ✓ Considering leaving
- ✓ Energy to conflict, not work

**Norming (Month 5):**
- ✓ "We" language emerges
- ✓ Processes working
- ✓ Comfortable interaction
- ✓ Mutual support
- ✓ Team identity formed
- ✓ Happy hour together

**Performing (Months 6-7):**
- ✓ Sustained excellence
- ✓ High autonomy
- ✓ Self-organized production fix
- ✓ Onboarded new member seamlessly
- ✓ Continuous improvement
- ✓ PM focused on obstacles only

**Adjourning (Month 8):**
- ✓ Project ending
- ✓ Emotional processing
- ✓ Reflection on journey
- ✓ Gratitude and sadness
- ✓ Desire to stay connected
- ✓ Learning captured

**The Turning Point (Month 4):**
The coffee conversation with Jordan after Sarah's facilitation was the moment the team transitioned from Storming to Norming.

**Not just the facilitated meeting, but the personal connection that followed.**

### Application to Your Leadership

**When you meet your new team (Month 1):**

**Remember:**
- They're optimistic and nervous (like Robin Month 1)
- They need structure and clarity
- Build foundation now
- Create psychological safety early

**Do:**
- Provide comprehensive onboarding
- Be highly visible and available
- Facilitate connections
- Set clear expectations

---

**When team hits Storming (Months 2-4):**

**Remember:**
- This is normal and necessary (not a failure)
- Someone on your team might be like Month 3 Robin (considering leaving but not telling you)
- The cost of avoiding is massive
- Your facilitation determines duration and outcome

**Do:**
- Intervene early when conflict becomes personal
- Facilitate structured discussions
- Don't take sides, facilitate resolution
- Create space for relationships to repair
- Be patient but active

---

**When team reaches Performing (Months 6-7):**

**Remember:**
- This was earned through earlier stages
- Took months to build
- Requires ongoing maintenance
- Is fragile (major changes can cause regression)

**Do:**
- Step back strategically
- Focus on external obstacles
- Trust their autonomy
- Continue recognition
- Protect from disruption

---

**When project ends (Month 8):**

**Remember:**
- Even great teams end
- People will have complex emotions
- Your closure impacts their next teams
- They'll remember forever how it ended

**Do:**
- Proper closure activities
- Individual and team reflection
- Capture lessons learned
- Celebrate accomplishments
- Support transitions
- Maintain relationships

---

### The Meta-Lesson

**Robin's story teaches the most important lesson about team development:**

**Great teams are not found, they're built.**

**They're built through:**
- Time together
- Shared challenges
- Working through conflict
- Building trust through difficulty
- Establishing processes
- Learning each other
- Progressing through stages

**You can't:**
- Skip to Performing
- Avoid Storming
- Rush the process
- Replace difficulty with efficiency

**You can:**
- Facilitate effectively
- Create conditions for growth
- Support the journey
- Be patient and present
- Trust the process

**Robin almost quit in Month 3.**

**In Month 8, Robin said it was the best team they'd ever been on.**

**Same team. Same people.**

**Different stage. Different facilitation. Different outcome.**

**That's the power of understanding and leading through team development stages.**

**End of Team Member Perspectives**

**Remember:** Empathy - the ability to understand and share the feelings of another - is the foundation of effective leadership. You can't lead people well without understanding what they experience under your leadership.

**Every time you make a leadership decision, ask:**
**"How will this feel to my team members?"**

**Then act with that understanding.**
