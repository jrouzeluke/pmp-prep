## Scenario 1: The New Project Team

### Situation

You've just been assigned as PM for a new mobile app development project. The team of 7 people met for the first time yesterday at the kickoff meeting. Team members include:
- 3 developers who have never worked together
- 1 UX designer new to the company
- 1 QA engineer who knows some team members
- 1 business analyst from another department
- 1 technical writer (contractor)

During the meeting, everyone was polite and took notes. Several people asked questions about their specific roles and responsibilities. The technical writer asked "What's the process for getting documents reviewed?" The business analyst asked "Who do I report to - you or my functional manager?" People seemed uncertain but eager.

After the meeting, two developers approached you separately to ask similar questions about the development environment and tools.

### Your Challenge

What should you do FIRST as the project manager?

**Option A:** Let the team self-organize and figure out their working relationships naturally over the next few weeks

**Option B:** Schedule individual meetings with each team member to understand their concerns and preferences

**Option C:** Create and share a detailed RACI matrix, establish ground rules, and set up regular team meetings

**Option D:** Assign the first set of tasks and let people start working while relationships develop

---

### Analysis

**Team Stage Diagnosis:**
- **Stage:** Forming
- **Evidence:** First meeting, polite behavior, many questions about roles/processes, uncertainty, seeking direction from PM, tentative interactions

**Key Indicators You Should Notice:**
- "Met for the first time yesterday" = brand new team
- "Everyone was polite" = characteristic Forming behavior
- Multiple questions about roles, processes, reporting = need for structure
- People approaching separately = haven't bonded yet, seeking individual clarity
- "Uncertain but eager" = classic Forming mindset

**What This Team Needs:**
- Clear structure and direction (Forming stage requirement)
- Explicit roles and responsibilities
- Defined processes and protocols
- Regular touchpoints for questions
- PM visibility and availability

---

### Answer & Explanation

✅ **Correct Answer: C** - Create and share detailed RACI matrix, establish ground rules, and set up regular team meetings

**Why This Is Best:**

This is the appropriate response for a team in Forming stage. The team needs:

1. **Structure** - RACI matrix provides role clarity
2. **Direction** - Ground rules establish expectations
3. **Regular touchpoints** - Meetings create predictability
4. **PM leadership** - Shows you're providing guidance they need

This approach addresses the specific needs demonstrated in the scenario:
- RACI matrix answers "who does what" questions
- Ground rules answer "how do we work together" questions
- Regular meetings create forum for ongoing questions
- Shows PM taking charge (appropriate for Forming)

**Leadership Style:** Authoritative/Commanding
- Provide structure without being asked
- Make decisions about team operations
- Set clear direction
- Don't delegate prematurely

---

### Why Other Options Are Wrong

❌ **Option A: Let team self-organize naturally**

**Why Wrong:**
- Forming teams CANNOT self-organize effectively
- Will cause confusion, anxiety, and wasted time
- Abdicates PM responsibility to provide structure
- Leads to prolonged Forming or early Storming

**What Would Happen:**
- Team members remain uncertain
- Different people make conflicting assumptions
- Gaps and overlaps in responsibilities
- Frustration builds
- Project start delayed

**Common Trap:** Confusing servant leadership with passive leadership. Servant leadership removes obstacles; it doesn't mean avoiding structure.

---

❌ **Option B: Schedule individual meetings with each member**

**Why Wrong:**
- While 1-on-1s are valuable, team needs collective clarity first
- Addresses concerns individually but not team formation
- Time-consuming before establishing basics
- Doesn't provide team-wide structure

**What Would Happen:**
- You'd hear similar questions 7 separate times
- Team still wouldn't know how to work together
- Information shared individually may not be consistent
- Team formation delayed

**When This IS Appropriate:** After team structure is established, 1-on-1s are excellent for building relationships and understanding individual needs.

---

❌ **Option D: Assign tasks and let people start working**

**Why Wrong:**
- Jumping to execution before establishing foundation
- Team doesn't know processes for completing tasks
- Likely to cause rework and confusion
- Ignores relationship-building needs

**What Would Happen:**
- People work in isolation
- Different approaches to same problems
- Rework when incompatibilities discovered
- Relationships don't form
- Quality issues

**Common Trap:** Pressure to "get started" causes skipping Forming activities. This creates bigger problems later.

---

### Key Learning Points

**For Forming Stage:**

✓ **Do:**
- Provide explicit structure immediately
- Answer questions patiently
- Establish clear processes
- Make decisions confidently
- Be highly visible and available
- Create forums for questions
- Facilitate team member introductions

✗ **Don't:**
- Expect self-organization
- Delegate strategic decisions
- Assume everyone knows processes
- Leave relationships to chance
- Be hands-off or distant

**Leadership Principle:**
New teams need PM to be directive and provide structure. This isn't micromanagement; it's appropriate leadership for team maturity level.

---

## Scenario 2: The Technical Debate

### Situation

Your software project team has been working together for 4 weeks. Today's planning meeting became heated when two senior developers (Alex and Jordan) started arguing about the technical architecture approach.

Alex advocates for a microservices architecture: "This is the modern approach. It's scalable, maintainable, and aligns with industry best practices. We'd be foolish not to use it."

Jordan pushes back strongly: "Microservices are overkill for our use case. They add unnecessary complexity. A monolithic approach will get us to market faster and be easier to maintain with our small team."

The argument has become increasingly tense:
- Both are talking over each other
- Other team members have gone silent
- The UX designer tried to change the subject
- The QA engineer quietly left the room
- Two junior developers are looking uncomfortable
- It's now 30 minutes into what should be a one-hour meeting

Neither Alex nor Jordan is backing down, and both keep looking at you to support their position.

### Your Challenge

What should you do RIGHT NOW?

**Option A:** Make the technical decision yourself immediately to end the argument and move on

**Option B:** Take a break, then facilitate a structured discussion where both present their cases with objective criteria

**Option C:** Tell Alex and Jordan to work it out between themselves offline and report back tomorrow

**Option D:** Side with the approach you think is better and explain your reasoning

---

### Analysis

**Team Stage Diagnosis:**
- **Stage:** Storming
- **Evidence:** Open conflict, tension, power struggle, other members withdrawing, productivity dropping, challenging each other

**Key Indicators You Should Notice:**
- "4 weeks" = typical timeframe for Storming to emerge
- "Arguing strongly" = conflict characteristic of Storming
- "Both looking at you for support" = testing PM authority
- "Other members silent/leaving" = discomfort with conflict
- "Talking over each other" = competition, not collaboration

**What This Team Needs:**
- Facilitation of conflict (not suppression or avoidance)
- Safe space to work through disagreement
- Process for resolving technical debates
- Recognition that conflict is normal and healthy
- PM to guide, not dictate

---

### Answer & Explanation

✅ **Correct Answer: B** - Take a break, then facilitate structured discussion where both present their cases with objective criteria

**Why This Is Best:**

This is appropriate Coaching leadership style for Storming stage:

1. **Acknowledges the conflict** - Taking a break recognizes tension
2. **Structures the discussion** - Provides framework for productive debate
3. **Facilitates, doesn't dictate** - PM guides process, not decision
4. **Respects both perspectives** - Both get to present fully
5. **Uses objective criteria** - Moves from positions to interests
6. **Teaches team** - Models how to handle future disagreements

**Specific Approach:**

"Let's take a 10-minute break. When we return, I'd like each of you to present your approach with these criteria: development time, scalability for our expected load, maintenance requirements with our team size, and risk factors. Then we'll discuss as a team and make a decision together."

This approach:
- Cools down emotions (break)
- Creates fair process (both present)
- Focuses on project needs (criteria)
- Involves whole team (collaborative decision)
- PM facilitates, doesn't dictate

**Leadership Style:** Coaching
- Facilitate through conflict
- Don't suppress disagreement
- Help team learn to resolve issues
- Guide process, not content

---

### Why Other Options Are Wrong

❌ **Option A: Make decision yourself immediately**

**Why Wrong:**
- Uses Commanding style inappropriately
- Doesn't help team learn to resolve conflicts
- Loses valuable technical input
- One person will feel shut down
- Misses opportunity to work through Storming
- May make suboptimal decision without full discussion

**What Would Happen:**
- Conflict goes underground
- Loser of argument resents decision
- Team learns PM will force decisions under pressure
- Future conflicts escalate to PM prematurely
- Prolongs Storming stage

**Leadership Style:** Commanding (inappropriate for this situation)

**When This WOULD Be Right:** True emergency where immediate decision required, no time for discussion. This technical architecture decision doesn't meet that threshold.

---

❌ **Option C: Tell them to work it out offline**

**Why Wrong:**
- Avoids PM's responsibility to facilitate
- Leaves two people in power struggle
- Rest of team excluded from important decision
- No structure for resolution
- May not resolve at all

**What Would Happen:**
- Alex and Jordan continue arguing without resolution
- Relationship damage between them
- Tomorrow's report may be "we still disagree"
- Team loses confidence in PM leadership
- Decision delayed indefinitely

**Leadership Style:** Avoiding (not a leadership style, but abdication)

**When This WOULD Be Right:** Minor disagreement that truly is just between two people and doesn't affect project, after you've coached them on how to resolve it.

---

❌ **Option D: Side with approach you think is better**

**Why Wrong:**
- Takes side in power struggle
- Alienates whoever you don't support
- Decision made without full technical analysis
- Doesn't teach team how to resolve conflicts
- May be wrong (you might not have all information)

**What Would Happen:**
- One person feels supported, other feels undermined
- Conflict becomes "PM vs. Jordan" (or Alex)
- Future disagreements become about winning PM support
- Technical merit becomes secondary to politics
- Damages team dynamics

**Leadership Style:** Commanding (forcing decision)

**Better Approach:** If you have technical opinion, share it as input during facilitated discussion, not as final decision.

---

### Key Learning Points

**For Storming Stage:**

✓ **Do:**
- Facilitate conflict, don't suppress it
- Create structured forums for disagreement
- Focus on interests and criteria, not positions
- Involve team in resolution
- Stay neutral as facilitator
- Acknowledge that conflict is normal and healthy
- Help team learn conflict resolution skills

✗ **Don't:**
- Avoid or ignore conflict
- Force quick resolution
- Take sides in power struggles
- Shut down debate prematurely
- Make it personal
- Let conflict become destructive

**Leadership Principle:**
Storming stage conflict is NECESSARY for team development. Your job is to facilitate healthy conflict resolution, not eliminate conflict. Teams that skip or suppress Storming never reach high performance.

**Recognition Point:**
Notice how the answer changed from Scenario 1 (Commanding/Authoritative) to Scenario 2 (Coaching). Same PM, same project, different team stage = different leadership style needed.

---

## Scenario 3: The High-Performing Team Faces a Challenge

### Situation

Your project team has been together for 7 months and is consistently exceeding expectations. They've delivered the last three sprints ahead of schedule with high quality. The team:
- Self-organizes effectively
- Resolves conflicts quickly without your involvement
- Makes good technical decisions autonomously
- Supports each other proactively
- Demonstrates high morale and engagement

You have daily standups but mostly just listen. The team runs sprint planning and retrospectives themselves. You focus on stakeholder management and removing organizational obstacles.

Today, a new requirement came down from the executive team: the product must integrate with a complex legacy system that no one on your team has experience with. This integration is critical and must be completed in the next sprint. The team is visibly concerned - several members have worked with this legacy system at previous companies and know it's notoriously difficult.

In today's standup, the tech lead said, "This legacy integration is going to be really challenging. None of us have done this specific integration before. We're going to need to figure out the approach."

### Your Challenge

How should you lead the team through this challenge?

**Option A:** Research the integration yourself, design the approach, and provide the team with detailed implementation instructions

**Option B:** Tell the team you trust them to figure it out and offer support if they need help

**Option C:** Bring in a consultant who has done this integration before to lead the technical work

**Option D:** Work alongside the team hands-on, demonstrating the pace and commitment needed to meet the deadline

---

### Analysis

**Team Stage Diagnosis:**
- **Stage:** Performing (being challenged but fundamentally still high-performing)
- **Evidence:** 7 months together, consistently exceeding expectations, self-organizing, autonomous decision-making, high morale

**Key Indicators You Should Notice:**
- "7 months" and "consistently exceeding" = Performing stage
- "Self-organizes effectively" = hallmark of Performing
- "Makes good decisions autonomously" = trust earned
- Challenge is NEW, not regression to earlier stage
- Team already discussing approach = taking initiative

**What This Team Needs:**
- Continued trust and empowerment
- Support and resources (not direction)
- Potential expertise if available
- Your confidence in their ability
- Removal of obstacles

**What This Team Does NOT Need:**
- PM to take over
- Micromanagement
- Loss of autonomy
- PM to solve their problems for them

---

### Answer & Explanation

✅ **Correct Answer: B** - Tell team you trust them to figure it out and offer support if they need help

**Why This Is Best:**

This is appropriate Delegating leadership style for Performing stage:

1. **Maintains trust** - Doesn't regress to directive style
2. **Preserves autonomy** - Team keeps decision-making authority
3. **Shows confidence** - Your belief supports their confidence
4. **Offers support** - Available but not imposing
5. **Respects capability** - Acknowledges their track record

**Specific Approach:**

"You've consistently tackled complex challenges successfully. I trust you to figure out this approach. Here's how I can support you:
- I can bring in an external expert if you want to consult with them
- I can buy you additional time if you need it
- I can get access to any resources or information you need
- I'm available to brainstorm if helpful

What would be most useful?"

This approach:
- Expresses confidence in team
- Offers specific support options
- Lets team decide what they need
- PM remains in support role
- Maintains high-performing dynamic

**Leadership Style:** Delegating
- Trust team's capability
- Offer support, don't impose direction
- Let them determine approach
- Focus on enabling, not directing

---

### Why Other Options Are Wrong

❌ **Option A: Research and provide detailed implementation instructions**

**Why Wrong:**
- Regresses to Forming stage leadership
- Micromanages high-performing team
- Undermines their confidence
- You likely don't have better technical knowledge
- Wastes your time on wrong priorities
- Damages trust and autonomy

**What Would Happen:**
- Team feels you don't trust them
- Motivation decreases
- They become dependent on you again
- Your solution may not be best (they know more)
- Future challenges escalate to you unnecessarily
- Team regresses in maturity

**Leadership Style:** Commanding (completely inappropriate here)

**When This WOULD Be Right:** With a brand new team in Forming stage lacking expertise. This team is Performing and has demonstrated capability.

---

❌ **Option C: Bring in consultant to lead the technical work**

**Why Wrong:**
- "Lead" takes authority from team
- Assumes team can't handle it (unsupported)
- External person leading undermines team
- Consultant doesn't know team's codebase
- Creates dependency on external expert

**What Would Happen:**
- Team feels sidelined
- Resentment at being replaced
- Integration may not fit team's architecture
- Expensive and probably unnecessary
- Team doesn't develop capability

**Better Version:** Offer to bring in consultant as ADVISOR if team requests it. Team remains in charge, consultant provides expertise.

**When External Expert IS Right:** When gap is genuinely beyond team's capability AND team agrees they need help. But let team lead even then.

---

❌ **Option D: Work alongside team hands-on, demonstrating pace and commitment**

**Why Wrong:**
- This is Pacesetting style
- Team doesn't need you to set pace
- They already demonstrate commitment
- Your presence may feel like micromanagement
- Takes you away from PM responsibilities

**What Would Happen:**
- Team interprets as lack of trust
- Your "help" may slow them down
- You're not doing PM work (stakeholder management, obstacle removal)
- Sets bad precedent (PM jumps in whenever hard)
- Can be demotivating ("PM doesn't think we can do it")

**Leadership Style:** Pacesetting (inappropriate for this situation)

**When This WOULD Be Right:** Short-term sprint to finish with a highly capable team that WANTS you working alongside them. Even then, ask first, don't impose.

---

### Key Learning Points

**For Performing Stage:**

✓ **Do:**
- Continue trusting and empowering
- Offer support and resources
- Remove obstacles in their way
- Express confidence in their ability
- Focus on strategic PM work
- Let team determine "how"
- Celebrate their successes

✗ **Don't:**
- Regress to directive leadership
- Micromanage when challenges arise
- Take over problem-solving
- Assume they can't handle difficulty
- Undermine their autonomy
- Jump in to "save" them

**Leadership Principle:**
High-performing teams EARNED your trust through demonstrated capability. Don't withdraw that trust at first sign of challenge. Challenges are opportunities for them to prove themselves again, not for you to take over.

**Common PM Mistake:**
Many PMs revert to directive style when challenges arise, even with Performing teams. Resist this urge. Your job with Performing teams is SUPPORT, not DIRECTION.

**Recognition Point:**
Notice that all three scenarios had different answers:
- Scenario 1 (Forming): Provide structure (Option C)
- Scenario 2 (Storming): Facilitate conflict (Option B)
- Scenario 3 (Performing): Trust and support (Option B, but different context)

Same person, different team stages = different leadership approaches.

---

## Scenario 4: The Burned-Out Team

### Situation

Your team has just completed a brutal 3-month push to meet a regulatory deadline. For the past 12 weeks:
- Team worked 60+ hour weeks
- Weekends were common
- Several family events were missed
- Stress was extremely high
- Quality concerns were raised but set aside
- Two team members cried at their desks

The deadline was met successfully yesterday. The regulatory submission was approved. Senior leadership sent congratulatory emails. Your sponsor is very pleased.

However, today you notice:
- Three team members called in sick
- Two others look exhausted
- Someone snapped at a colleague over a minor issue
- The usually collaborative team seems irritable
- People are working at individual desks instead of collaborating
- One team member updated their LinkedIn profile (you saw their screen)

Your sponsor just emailed: "Great work on the regulatory deadline! Now we need to start the Phase 2 build immediately. The CEO wants to see progress by next week. Can your team start sprint planning today?"

### Your Challenge

What should you do?

**Option A:** Schedule sprint planning for today and start Phase 2 immediately as requested

**Option B:** Request a 1-2 week recovery period before starting Phase 2, arrange team celebration, and check in individually with team members

**Option C:** Start Phase 2 but with reduced hours (40-hour weeks instead of 60)

**Option D:** Tell sponsor the team needs recovery time but start planning Phase 2 yourself to show progress

---

### Analysis

**Team Stage Diagnosis:**
- **Stage:** Risk of regression from previous stage due to exhaustion
- **Current State:** Burned out, stressed, relationships strained
- **Evidence:** Physical exhaustion, irritability, sick days, isolation, job searching signals

**Key Indicators You Should Notice:**
- "Brutal 3-month push" = unsustainable pace
- "Weekends, 60+ hours, missed family events" = work-life imbalance
- "Two team members cried" = emotional breaking point
- "Snapped at colleague" = frayed relationships
- "LinkedIn profile update" = flight risk
- "Three sick" = physical/emotional exhaustion

**What This Team Needs:**
- Immediate recovery time
- Acknowledgment of their sacrifice
- Relationship repair
- Physical and emotional rest
- Reassurance that pace was temporary
- Recognition and appreciation

**What This Team Does NOT Need:**
- More pressure
- Immediate return to intensity
- Lack of acknowledgment
- Expectation that pace is new normal

---

### Answer & Explanation

✅ **Correct Answer: B** - Request 1-2 week recovery period, arrange team celebration, check in individually with team members

**Why This Is Best:**

This is appropriate Affiliative leadership style for team crisis:

1. **Prioritizes people** - Recognizes team needs recovery
2. **Acknowledges sacrifice** - Celebration shows appreciation
3. **Repairs relationships** - Addresses interpersonal strain
4. **Prevents bigger problems** - Stops burnout from becoming resignations
5. **Manages sponsor** - Educates sponsor on team needs
6. **Shows you care** - Individual check-ins demonstrate concern

**Specific Approach:**

**To Sponsor:**
"The team delivered exceptional results under extreme pressure. To maintain their capability for Phase 2 and beyond, we need 1-2 weeks for recovery. Starting immediately would risk quality issues, attrition, and burnout. I recommend we kick off Phase 2 on [date]. This investment in our team will pay dividends in sustained performance."

**To Team:**
"You accomplished something remarkable. Before we start Phase 2, we're taking recovery time. I've arranged [celebration]. Take time to rest, reconnect with family, and recover. I'll be doing individual check-ins to hear how you're doing and what you need. Phase 2 will be different - sustainable pace, proper planning, and your well-being is priority."

**Individual Check-Ins Should Cover:**
- How are you really doing?
- What do you need to recover?
- How can I support you?
- What should Phase 2 look like?
- What do we need to do differently?

**Leadership Style:** Affiliative
- People first, tasks second
- Acknowledge emotions and sacrifice
- Repair relationships
- Show genuine care
- Build trust through action

---

### Why Other Options Are Wrong

❌ **Option A: Start sprint planning today for Phase 2**

**Why Wrong:**
- Ignores team's exhausted state
- Risks burnout becoming permanent
- Shows no appreciation for sacrifice
- Likely to trigger resignations
- Quality will suffer
- Unsustainable long-term

**What Would Happen:**
- At least one resignation (probably more)
- Dramatically reduced productivity
- Quality problems in Phase 2
- Team resentment ("We're just resources")
- Long-term motivation damage
- Potential project failure

**Leadership Style:** Pacesetting (continuing unsustainable pace)

**Message Sent to Team:** "Your sacrifice doesn't matter. Your well-being doesn't matter. You're just expected to keep going."

---

❌ **Option C: Start Phase 2 but reduce to 40-hour weeks**

**Why Wrong:**
- Still doesn't provide recovery time
- 40 hours on top of exhaustion is still too much
- Doesn't address relationship strain
- No acknowledgment or appreciation
- Assumes physical presence = productivity

**What Would Happen:**
- Team physically present but not productive
- Resentment continues
- Quality suffers
- Burnout deepens
- Relationships continue deteriorating
- Job searching continues

**Leadership Style:** Attempting compromise but missing the point

**Why 40 Hours Isn't Enough:** After 3 months of 60+ hour weeks, people need actual time off to recover, not just "normal" hours. They're starting from depleted, not baseline.

---

❌ **Option D: Request recovery time but start planning yourself**

**Why Wrong:**
- Better than A or C, but still problematic
- Planning without team loses their input
- Sends message that you don't trust their recovery
- PM burnout risk
- Team may resent plans made without them
- Defeats purpose of recovery time

**What Would Happen:**
- Team recovers physically but not relationally
- Return to plans they didn't create
- Sense of being left out
- May not align with what team needs
- PM exhaustion

**When This MIGHT Work:** If sponsor demands showing SOME progress and you create high-level outline only, explicitly positioning it as draft for team to shape when they return.

**Better Approach:** Negotiate with sponsor based on team's actual needs, not compromise team's recovery to please sponsor.

---

### Key Learning Points

**For Burned-Out Teams:**

✓ **Do:**
- Acknowledge sacrifice explicitly
- Provide real recovery time
- Show genuine concern
- Check in individually
- Celebrate accomplishments
- Make changes to prevent recurrence
- Put people before tasks

✗ **Don't:**
- Ignore exhaustion
- Rush to next thing
- Take sacrifice for granted
- Assume "normal" hours are enough
- Skip appreciation
- Let sponsor pressure override team needs
- Risk losing valuable team members

**Leadership Principle:**
People are not machines. Extreme effort requires recovery. Failing to provide it causes long-term damage to individuals, team, and project. Pushing burned-out people harder is both unethical and ineffective.

**Sponsor Management:**
Your job includes managing sponsor expectations about team capability and sustainability. Educate sponsors that teams need recovery after intense periods. Good sponsors will understand; if they don't, protect your team anyway.

**Recognition Point:**
This scenario requires Affiliative style even though team may have been Performing before burnout. Circumstances changed the team's needs dramatically. Always adapt to current reality, not past state.

---

## Scenario 5: The Team Member Crisis

### Situation

Your team has been in the Norming stage for 6 weeks, working well together with good collaboration and mutual respect. This morning, Sarah (senior developer) pulls you aside privately:

"I need to tell you something that's affecting my work. My father was diagnosed with cancer last week. He's starting treatment next month. I'm going to need to take time off for appointments and may need to work from his city occasionally. I'm trying to keep it together, but I'm honestly struggling. I haven't told the team yet because I don't want them to think I can't handle my work."

Sarah is clearly emotional but trying to hold it together. She's been one of your most reliable team members and has strong relationships with everyone on the team.

### Your Challenge

How should you respond?

**Option A:** Thank her for telling you, offer flexibility with schedule, suggest she tell the team when ready, and offer to help communicate if she wants

**Option B:** Give her time off immediately and reassign her work to other team members to reduce her stress

**Option C:** Express sympathy but explain that the project timeline is tight and you need her to maintain her commitments

**Option D:** Suggest she keep it private from the team to maintain professional boundaries and avoid affecting team morale

---

### Analysis

**Situation Type:**
- **Nature:** Personal crisis affecting team member
- **Stage Impact:** Could affect team stage if not handled well
- **Leadership Need:** Empathy, support, and practical help

**Key Indicators You Should Notice:**
- "Clearly emotional" = in crisis
- "Trying to hold it together" = struggling to cope
- "Struggling" = honest admission of difficulty
- "Hasn't told team" = uncertain about sharing
- "Don't want them to think I can't handle" = fear of judgment
- "Reliable team member" = proven capability

**What Sarah Needs:**
- Empathy and emotional support
- Practical flexibility
- Reassurance she won't be penalized
- Help thinking through how to handle it
- Not feeling isolated
- Control over her own choices

**What Project Needs:**
- Sarah's work covered (with her input)
- Team aware so they can support
- Realistic planning around her availability
- Sarah to remain engaged (not pushed out)

---

### Answer & Explanation

✅ **Correct Answer: A** - Thank her for telling you, offer flexibility, suggest she tell team when ready, offer to help communicate

**Why This Is Best:**

This demonstrates emotional intelligence and appropriate Affiliative leadership:

1. **Shows empathy** - Acknowledges human situation
2. **Offers support** - Practical flexibility
3. **Respects autonomy** - She decides about team
4. **Offers assistance** - Help if wanted
5. **Builds trust** - Creates psychological safety
6. **Balances needs** - Person and project

**Specific Response:**

"Sarah, thank you for trusting me with this. I'm so sorry about your father. Here's how we'll handle this:

**For you:**
- Take whatever time you need for appointments
- Work remotely when you need to be with your father
- No judgment on productivity - we understand
- Let me know what you need day by day

**For the team:**
I think telling them would be good - they care about you and can support you. But that's your choice. If you want, I can help you tell them, or I can tell them if you prefer. They'll want to help.

**For the work:**
Let's talk through your current work. What can we defer? What needs coverage? We'll figure this out together.

What would be most helpful for you right now?"

**Leadership Style:** Affiliative
- Person before task
- Empathy and support
- Flexible and understanding
- Build trust through care

---

### Why Other Options Are Wrong

❌ **Option B: Give time off immediately and reassign her work**

**Why Wrong:**
- Makes decision for her without consultation
- May feel like being pushed out
- Removes her agency
- Might increase stress (feeling replaced)
- Doesn't ask what SHE wants
- Work might be distraction she needs

**What Would Happen:**
- Sarah might feel sidelined
- Could feel like punishment
- May want to stay engaged
- Relationship with team disrupted abruptly
- She loses sense of control
- May resent the decision

**When This WOULD Be Right:** If Sarah explicitly asks for extended leave or if her performance clearly shows she can't continue working.

**Better Approach:** ASK what she needs rather than deciding for her.

---

❌ **Option C: Express sympathy but explain timeline requires her to maintain commitments**

**Why Wrong:**
- Puts project before person
- Creates no-win situation for Sarah
- Destroys psychological safety
- Shows no empathy in action
- Will damage trust permanently
- Likely lose her eventually
- Unethical

**What Would Happen:**
- Sarah feels abandoned and betrayed
- Tries to work through crisis, burns out
- Performance suffers anyway
- Rest of team finds out, loses respect for PM
- Sarah likely leaves when father's treatment ends
- Team morale damaged
- Reputation as uncaring manager

**Leadership Style:** None - this is just bad leadership

**Reality Check:** People will remember how you treated them in crisis forever. This approach guarantees Sarah never trusts you again and tells others not to either.

---

❌ **Option D: Suggest keeping it private to maintain professional boundaries**

**Why Wrong:**
- Isolates Sarah when she needs support
- Team will notice she's struggling and worry
- Prevents team from helping
- "Professional boundaries" used to avoid dealing with reality
- People are human, not machines
- Damages team culture

**What Would Happen:**
- Sarah carries burden alone
- Team notices something wrong, doesn't know why
- Speculation and worry
- Sarah can't explain schedule changes
- Team feels shut out
- Support system not activated
- Sarah's stress increases

**When Privacy IS Right:** When Sarah explicitly wants to keep it private. But even then, you should gently suggest benefits of team support.

**Reality:** Teams that support each other through personal challenges become stronger, not weaker. This builds psychological safety and trust.
